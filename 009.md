# _getValueOfWithdrawRequest() calculates the wrong ValueOfWithdrawRequest.

## Summary
``_getValueOfWithdrawRequest()`` calculates the wrong ``ValueOfWithdrawRequest``. As a result, a user will withdraw the wrong amount of borrowed tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail

``Ethena._getValueOfWithdrawRequest()``  will calcualte the value of a WithdrawRequest:

However, when converting USDe to borrowed tokens, it uses multiplication instead of division for the ```usdeToBorrowRate```:

```javascript
 return (userCooldown.underlyingAmount * usdeToBorrowRate.toUint() * borrowPrecision) /
            (Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION * USDE_PRECISION);
```
As a result, the value is wrong. Since this function is very fundamental, this means, the amount a user withdraws will not be correct. A user might lose funds because of this. 

## Impact

_getValueOfWithdrawRequest() calculates the wrong ValueOfWithdrawRequest. A user/the protocol might lose funding during withdrawal.
