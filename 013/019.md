# Usage of transfer() can result in revert in the `redeemFromNotional`

## Summary
The `redeemFromNotional` function in `BaseStrategyVault.sol` uses the deprecated `transfer()` function which can result in reverts if the underlying token is ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `transfer()` function uses a fixed gas amount of 2300, which can cause reverts if the recipient is a contract that requires more than 2300 gas to execute.
Since NOTIONAL is the proxy contract, if the redeemFromNotional function is called with ETH as the underlying token, the transfer() function will revert as the proxy contract will use more than 2300 gas.
Additionally, the receiver could be a multisig wallet or another contract that requires more than 2300 gas.

## Impact
The redeemFromNotional function will revert, preventing users from redeeming their funds from the vault if the underlying token is ETH.

## Recommendation
Use `call` instead of `transfer()`. Example: `(bool succeeded, ) = _to.call{value: _amount}(""); require(succeeded, "Transfer failed.");`
