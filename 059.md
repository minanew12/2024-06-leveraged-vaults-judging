# Some user funds will be struck and unable to be withdrawn

## Summary
Some user funds will be struck and unable to be withdrawn.
## Vulnerability Detail
The calculation of vault shares when depositing is as follows:
> vault shares = amount of STAKING_TOKEN * INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION / STAKING_PRECISION

The calculation of redeem amount when withdrawing is as follows:
> redeem amount = vault shares * STAKING_PRECISION / INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION

Let's take a example: 
INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION = 1e8
STAKING_PRECISION = 1e18 (staking token decimal = 18)
User A deposits. The amount of staking token amount = 2e10 - 1.
```solidity
➜ uint256 amount = 2e10 - 1
➜ amount * 1e8 / 1e18
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
├ Hex (full word): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
└ Decimal: 1
```
He gets 1 vaultShares.
He withdraws 1 vaultShares.
```solidity
➜ 1 * 1e18 / 1e8
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002540be400
├ Hex (full word): 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002540be400
└ Decimal: 10000000000
```
He withdraws 1e10 staking token.
So (2e10 - 1 - 1e10) amount of staking token will be struck in the vault.
## Impact
Some staking token will be struck in the vault and users lose funds.

## Recommendation
Changing INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION isn't practical. Recommend to use [openzeppelin library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol).
