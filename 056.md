# Premature collateralization check in the `BaseStakingVault.initiateWithdraw()` function can leave accounts undercollateralized

## Summary

The collateralization check is currently performed before the user action that impacts the account's collateralization.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `initiateWithdraw()` function can affect the solvency of the account. During this process, tokens may be unwrapped and new tokens pushed into the withdrawal queue, altering the underlying tokens for which collateralization was initially checked. This can result in a different collateralization level than initially assessed.

Additionally, this contradicts how Notional core contracts perform such checks, where they are always conducted as the final step in any user interaction.

## Impact

The account may become undercollateralized or insolvent following the user action.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Perform the account collateralization check after the `_initiateWithdraw()` function call:

```diff
function initiateWithdraw() external {
+       _initiateWithdraw({account: msg.sender, isForced: false});

        (VaultAccountHealthFactors memory health, /* */, /* */) = NOTIONAL.getVaultAccountHealthFactors(
            msg.sender, address(this)
        );
        VaultConfig memory config = NOTIONAL.getVaultConfig(address(this));
        // Require that the account is collateralized
        require(config.minCollateralRatio <= health.collateralRatio, "Insufficient Collateral");

-       _initiateWithdraw({account: msg.sender, isForced: false});
    }
}
```
