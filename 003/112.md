# Using `block.timestamp` for deadline offers no protection

## Summary
`Block.timestamp` is being used as a deadline, which offers no real protection since it will have the value of the block the miners mine it to..
This means the miner can insert these transactions to the block anytime he chooses which can make it unfavorable.
## Vulnerability Detail
In [`_redeemFromNotional`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L170), [`_executeInstantRedemption`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L197), [`_stakeTokens`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/EthenaVault.sol#L65), [`_sellStakedUSDe`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/Ethena.sol#L138-L158), [`_stakeTokens`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/PendlePrincipalToken.sol#L86) &[`_executeInstantRedemption`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/PendlePrincipalToken.sol#L155) functions we can find a deadline within a Trade block setting the `deadline` to `block.timestamp` which is not effective considering how the blockchain works
## Impact
`Block.timestamp` offers no real protection,
## Code Snippet

This block of code is found in all the functions mentioned above 
```solidity
Trade memory trade = Trade({
                tradeType: TradeType.EXACT_IN_SINGLE,
                sellToken: BORROW_TOKEN,
                buyToken: address(USDe),
                amount: depositUnderlyingExternal,
                limit: params.minPurchaseAmount,
                //@audit ineffective
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                exchangeData: params.exchangeData
            });
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a proper deadline logic
either it will be an input param or better
