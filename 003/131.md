# Missing deadline checks allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed

## Summary
Missing deadline checks allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed
## Vulnerability Detail
- The `BaseStakingVault` contract does not allow users to submit a deadline for their action. This missing feature enables pending transactions to be maliciously executed at a later point.
- Contract should provide their users with an option to limit the execution of their pending actions, such as while redeeming. The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter (for example see [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L229)). If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades.
- Without an expiration deadline, a malicious miner/validator can hold a transaction until they favor it or they can make a profit
## Impact
- Pending transactions can be maliciously executed at a later point causing damage to users.
- Without an expiration deadline, a malicious miner/validator can hold a transaction until they favor it or they can make a profit.
