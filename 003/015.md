# `block.timestamp` used as `_executeTrade` deadline offers no protection

## Summary
`block.timestamp` used as `_executeTrade` deadline offers no protection.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol is using `block.timestamp` as the `deadline` argument while trading. Using `block.timestamp` as the deadline is effectively a no-operation that has no effect nor protection. Since `block.timestamp` will take the timestamp value when the transaction gets mined. Without a deadline, the transaction might be left hanging in the mempool and be executed way later than the user wanted.
That could lead to users getting a worse price.

## Impact
Deadline using `block.timestamp` is useless.
