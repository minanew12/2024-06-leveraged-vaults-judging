# Corruptible Upgradability Pattern



## Summary
Storage of PendlePTKelpVault and PendlePTStakedUSDeVault contracts might be corrupted during upgrade
## Vulnerability Detail
The PendlePT staking vaults are meant to be upgradeable.  However, they inherit contracts that are not upgrade-safe.

The BaseStrategyVault have gap storage, But The WithdrawRequestBase,  BaseStakingVault and PendlePrincipalToken, 
which are inherited by PendlePT staking vaults .

Thus, adding new storage variables to WithdrawRequestBase,  BaseStakingVault and PendlePrincipalToken can potentially overwrite the beginning of the storage layout of the child contracts, causing critical misbehavior in the system.


## Impact
Storage of PendlePTKelpVault and PendlePTStakedUSDeVault  contracts might be corrupted during upgrade, thus causing the vaults to be broken and assets to be stuck.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider defining an appropriate storage gap in the upgradeable parent contracts at the end of all the storage variable definitions as follows:
