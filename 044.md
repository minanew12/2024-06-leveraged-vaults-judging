# After a liquidator liquidates someone else’s position, it could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) when their own position also needs to be liquidated.


## Summary
After a liquidator liquidates someone else’s position, it could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) when their own position also needs to be liquidated.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
 function _splitWithdrawRequest(address _from, address _to, uint256 vaultShares) internal {
        WithdrawRequest storage w = VaultStorage.getAccountWithdrawRequest()[_from];
        if (w.requestId == 0) return;

        // Create a new split withdraw request
        if (!w.hasSplit) {
            SplitWithdrawRequest memory s = VaultStorage.getSplitWithdrawRequest()[w.requestId];
            // Safety check to ensure that the split withdraw request is not active, split withdraw
            // requests are never deleted. This presumes that all withdraw request ids are unique.
            require(s.finalized == false && s.totalVaultShares == 0);
            VaultStorage.getSplitWithdrawRequest()[w.requestId].totalVaultShares = w.vaultShares;
        }

        if (w.vaultShares == vaultShares) {
            // If the resulting vault shares is zero, then delete the request. The _from account's
            // withdraw request is fully transferred to _to
            delete VaultStorage.getAccountWithdrawRequest()[_from];
        } else {
            // Otherwise deduct the vault shares
@>>            w.vaultShares = w.vaultShares - vaultShares;
            w.hasSplit = true;
        }

        // Ensure that no withdraw request gets overridden, the _to account always receives their withdraw
        // request in the account withdraw slot.
        WithdrawRequest storage toWithdraw = VaultStorage.getAccountWithdrawRequest()[_to];
        require(toWithdraw.requestId == 0 || toWithdraw.requestId == w.requestId , "Existing Request");

        // Either the request gets set or it gets incremented here.
         toWithdraw.requestId = w.requestId;
        toWithdraw.vaultShares = toWithdraw.vaultShares + vaultShares;
        toWithdraw.hasSplit = true;
    }
```
Here is an assumption: the requested withdrawal vaultShares are always greater than or equal to vaultSharesFromLiquidation. This assumption holds true for regular users because the requested withdrawal vaultShares represent the user’s entire vaultShares. However, this assumption does not hold for liquidators.
POC：
The liquidator：vaultShares 10e8
A user need to be liquidated:  vaultShares 1e8,  withdrawRequest.vaultShares 1e8
the vaultSharesFromLiquidation is 1e8.
- After liquidation:
The liquidator：vaultShares 11e8, withdrawRequest.vaultShares 1e8
- After sometime,The liquidator’s position need to be liquidated
the vaultSharesFromLiquidation is 2e8.
Then `w.vaultShares = w.vaultShares - vaultShares;` will revert()
This results in the liquidator’s position not being liquidated, leading to a loss of funds for the protocol.
## Impact
This results in the liquidator’s position not being liquidated, leading to a loss of funds for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider the case where w.vaultShares is less than vaultShares.
