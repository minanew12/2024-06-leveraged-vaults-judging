# No check if An account is healthy during liquidations.

## Summary
During liquidation in `BaseStakingVault.sol` the account to be liquidated isn't checked if its  under The minCollateralRatio or not.Therefore, all accounts can get liquidated even if the account is healthy.
## Vulnerability Detail
an attacker takes out a flashloan.
calls `deleverageAccount` on every account that is valid.
Since the check that happens is if the health has improved.
All accounts get liquidated 
the liquidator pays back flashloan. and remains with profit.

## Impact
funds can get stolen with a liquidator.
## Code Snippet

```javascript
  function deleverageAccount(
        address account,
        address vault,
        address liquidator,
        uint16 currencyIndex,
        int256 depositUnderlyingInternal
    ) external payable override virtual returns (
        uint256 vaultSharesFromLiquidation,
        int256 depositAmountPrimeCash
    ) {
        require(msg.sender == liquidator);
        _checkReentrancyContext();
        (VaultAccountHealthFactors memory healthBefore, /* */, /* */) = NOTIONAL.getVaultAccountHealthFactors(
            account, vault
        );
        //@audit there is no requirement that heathBefore is healthy or not.
        require(0 <= healthBefore.collateralRatio, "Insolvent");
        (vaultSharesFromLiquidation, depositAmountPrimeCash) = NOTIONAL.deleverageAccount{value: msg.value}(
            account, vault, liquidator, currencyIndex, depositUnderlyingInternal
        );

  
        _splitWithdrawRequest(account, liquidator, vaultSharesFromLiquidation);

        (VaultAccountHealthFactors memory healthAfter, /* */, /* */) = NOTIONAL.getVaultAccountHealthFactors(
            account, vault
        );
    
        require(healthBefore.collateralRatio < healthAfter.collateralRatio, "Collateral Decrease");
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a requirement if healthFactor is  healthy revert() .
```diff
  require(msg.sender == liquidator);
        _checkReentrancyContext();
        (VaultAccountHealthFactors memory healthBefore, /* */, /* */) = NOTIONAL.getVaultAccountHealthFactors(
            account, vault
        );
        //@audit there is no requirement that heathBefore is healthy or not.
        require(0 <= healthBefore.collateralRatio, "Insolvent");
+   VaultConfig memory config = NOTIONAL.getVaultConfig(address(this));
        // Require that the account to be liquidated is underThe minCollateralRatio
+        require(config.minCollateralRatio >= health.collateralRatio, "Account is healthy");


```
