# `BaseStrategyVault::liquidateVaultCashBalance()` are not override in BaseStakingVault.sol



## Summary
`BaseStrategyVault::liquidateVaultCashBalance()` are not override in BaseStakingVault.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
The BaseStakingVault contract inherits from the BaseStrategyVault contract. In the BaseStakingVault.sol contract, the deleverageAccount function is overridden to handle the WithDrawRequest scenario. However, the liquidateVaultCashBalance() function is not overridden. If a liquidator uses liquidateVaultCashBalance() for liquidation, it will fail to handle the WithDrawRequest scenario.
```javascript
function liquidateVaultCashBalance(
        address account,
        address vault,
        address liquidator,
        uint256 currencyIndex,
        int256 fCashDeposit
    ) external returns (int256 cashToLiquidator) {
        require(msg.sender == liquidator);
        return NOTIONAL.liquidateVaultCashBalance(
            account, vault, liquidator, currencyIndex, fCashDeposit
        );
    }
```
## Impact
This results in users being unable to withdraw their funds.

## Recommendation
