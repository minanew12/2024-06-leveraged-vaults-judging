# call() should be used instead of transfer() on an address payable

## Summary
The BaseStrategyVault contract use `transfer()` function to send ETH to receiver and notional when redeeming from notional but since it uses fixed 2300 gas for execution it can lead to unexpected results.

## Vulnerability Detail

The transfer() function forward a fixed amount of 2300 gas. Making fixed assummptions about gas cost can break the already deployed contract in the event of a hardfork like the EIP 1884 case that broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.


## Impact

The use of transfer() function for an address will make the transaction fail when:

- Receiver or Notional smart contract implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.
- Receiver or Notional  smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units which is OK but is called through proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.
- Additionally the Receiver could be using a multisig wallet that use more than 2300 gas in the receive function.

## Code Snippet

Use `transfer` when sending ETH to receiver and notional

## Recommendation

Use call() instead of transfer(), use CEI pattern and reentracy guards. 

```javascript
        if (_UNDERLYING_IS_ETH) {
            if (transferToReceiver > 0) {
              (bool success, ) = payable(receiver).call{value: transferToReceiver}("");
              require(success, "Transfer receiver Failed");
            }
            if (transferToNotional > 0) {
              (bool success, ) = payable(address(NOTIONAL)).call{value: transferToNotional}("");
              require(success, "Transfer notional Failed");
            }
        } else {
            ....
        }
  ```
