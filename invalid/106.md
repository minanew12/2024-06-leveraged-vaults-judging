# `PendlePTOracle::twapDuration` should not be immutable

## Summary
[`twapDuration`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/oracles/PendlePTOracle.sol#L14) is set to an immutable variable, this is not advisable as it poses a great risk after deployment
## Vulnerability Detail
The `twapDuration`  determines the update period for which TWAP oracles will allow a new price to be fetched, 

`uint32 public immutable twapDuration;`

as we can see variable is set to immutable 

the owner of the contract or admin should be allowed to dynamically set it based on market conditions, the inability to set it after deployment will pose a great risk if the market takes a different turn.

more on this bug [here](https://33audits.hashnode.dev/twap-oracles-for-auditors#heading-common-issues-found-with-twap)
## Impact
Inability to dynamically set it after deployment as a result makes as stuck on one twapDuration 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
contract PendlePTOracle is AggregatorV2V3Interface {
    using TypeConvert for uint256;

    address public immutable pendleMarket;
    // @audit should be changeable not immutable 
    uint32 public immutable twapDuration;
    bool public immutable useSyOracleRate;
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The variable should be dynamic and be able to be set by the protocol owners or admin to meet current market conditions
