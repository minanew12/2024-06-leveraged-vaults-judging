# updateRewardToken() does not account for the remaining rewards for old emission rates, as a result, some rewards will be lost forever.

## Summary
updateRewardToken() does not account for the remaining rewards for old emission rates, as a result, some rewards will be lost forever.

Moever, updateRewardToken() fails to check that a newly added reward token already exists, as a result duplicate reward tokens are possible and lead to confused state, and possibly loss of funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

updateRewardToken() allows the NOTIONAL owner to modify the emission rate of a reward token:

The problem is that it will simply call ```_accumulateSecondaryRewardViaEmissionRate(index, state, totalVaultSharesBefore)``` to accumulate under the old regime up to the current time and then replace the old ``emissionRatePerYear`` by the new one. 
This means, existing regime might have some remaining rewards that have not been accumulated yet when ```state.endTime > block.timestamp``` in the amount of:

```(state.endTime - block.timestamp) * state.emissionRatePerYear)/ (Constants.YEAR```.

AS a result, this amount of rewards will be lost forever. This amount, should have been incorporated into the new emission rate.

In addition, when  ```index == settings.numRewardTokens```, a new reward token will be added. However, this new reward token could be a duplicate (it already exists as one of the existing rewards tokens). updateRewardToken() does not check such duplicate. 
As a result, when such duplicate occurs, the system could be in a wrong state, and a user for example might double claim the same reward token.  For example, VaultRewardLib._claimVaultRewards() will call a duplicate reward token _accumulateSecondaryRewardViaClaim() twice, and as a result, ```  state.accumulatedRewardPerVaultShare += (
            (tokensClaimed * uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION)) / totalVaultSharesBefore
        ).toUint128();``` will be executed twice for the same reward token. which mean,s the reward is accumulated twice via claim.


## Impact

updateRewardToken() does not account for the remaining rewards for old emission rates, as a result, some rewards will be lost forever.

## Recommendation
The amount of rewards that have not been accumulated yet should have been incorporated into the new emission rate.
