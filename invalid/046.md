# The `VaultRewarderLib::deleverageAccount` function can be abused by users of staking leverage vaults.


## Summary
The `VaultRewarderLib::deleverageAccount` function can be abused by users of staking leverage vaults.
## Vulnerability Detail
A user has vaultShares in staking leverage vaults, such as PendlePTEtherFiVault. Who have already called the `initiateWithdraw()`.
Assume the user’s vaultShares are 9e8, then withdraw.vaultShares are 9e8.
The attacker  calls   `VaultRewarderLib::deleverageAccount` instead of `PendlePTEtherFiVault::deleverageAccount`, skip the _splitWithdrawRequest. 
After operation:
Assume the user’s vaultShares are 1e8, then withdraw.vaultShares are 9e8.
the attacker’s vaultShares are 8e8.
Due to the requirement in the _redeemFromNotional function that vaultShares == vaultSharesRedeemed, this results in the user’s vaultShares not being redeemable. The attacker will not incur any losses.
```javascript
 function deleverageAccount(
        address account,
        address vault,
        address liquidator,
        uint16 currencyIndex,
        int256 depositUnderlyingInternal
    ) external payable returns (uint256 vaultSharesFromLiquidation, int256 depositAmountPrimeCash) {
        // Record all vault share values before
        uint256 totalVaultSharesBefore = VaultStorage.getStrategyVaultState().totalVaultSharesGlobal;
        uint256 accountVaultSharesBefore = _getVaultSharesBefore(account);
        uint256 liquidatorVaultSharesBefore = _getVaultSharesBefore(liquidator);

        // Forward the liquidation call to Notional
        (
            vaultSharesFromLiquidation,
            depositAmountPrimeCash
        ) = Deployments.NOTIONAL.deleverageAccount{value: msg.value}(
            account, vault, liquidator, currencyIndex, depositUnderlyingInternal
        );
@>>    //skipped the _splitWithdrawRequest
       
    }
```
## Impact
This results in a loss of funds for the user.
