# No checks present in the `getRewardSettings()` function of `VaultRewarderLib.sol` to ensure if the index `for` loop is going out of bound, can lead to potential DoS attacks.

## Summary
No checks present in the `getRewardSettings()` function of `VaultRewarderLib.sol` to ensure if the index `for` loop it can lead to data corruption and DoS attacks as the function may revert because of incorrect memory access

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `getRewardSettings()` function the loop 
```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < v.length; i++) v[i] = store[i];
```
does not check for out of bound condition. 

And the length of `v` can be different from `store` as :
Value of `v` depends on `VaultRewardState[](s.numRewardTokens)` 
Value of `store` depends on `VaultStorage.getVaultRewardState()`

No checks are present to ensure if they have the same length. And as the loop runs till `i<v.length` and mapping store if updated on basis of that `store[i]`.
If length of `v` < `store` : it will leave empty spots in the mapping.
If length of `v` > `store` : it can lead to overflow or out of bound error.

## Impact
No checks are present to ensure `v` and `store` have the same length as array checks for the element out of bounds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement checks to ensure the lengths of `v` and `store` are same
Implement upper bound for the loop.
