# Contracts not using safe math

## Summary
Not using `SafeMath` can lead to overflow & underflow of arithmetic calculations


## Vulnerability Details
Calculations that do not check for under/overflow can easily cause severe issues in Solidity.
The contract `PendlePTOracle.sol` , `VaultRewarderLib.sol` ,`PendlePTEtherFiVault.sol` , `BaseStakingVault.sol` and more, do not use `SafeMath` to prevent overflow and underflow in arithmetic operations. 
In the `PendlePTOracle.sol`, `_calculateBaseToQuote` function they have a comment at the top that says, "Overflow and div by zero not possible" [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/14d3eaf0445c251c52c86ce88a84a3f5b9dfad94/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/oracles/PendlePTOracle.sol#L110), this is just an assumption with no valid check. Majority of contracts that perform calculations, have used `SafeMath`. 


## Impact

The only valid reason for not using `SafeMath` is that the design of the system makes it impossible for overflows or underflows to occur. But even in that case, the only way to prove it is with extensive formal verifications, and a mistake in any place of the system could be catastrophic.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using using `SafeMath` for all calculations and adding a comment to every statement with an arithmetic operation explaining why it is safe. Ideally, these claims would be accompanied by a formal verification.
