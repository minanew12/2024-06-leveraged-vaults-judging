# Missing implementation of `ClonedCoolDownHolder:rescueTokens` inside the `PendlePTKelpVault` and `PendlePTStakedUSDeVault` vaults

## Summary

The function `ClonedCoolDownHolder:rescueTokens` is not implemented and can't be called by the vaults `PendlePTKelpVault` and `PendlePTStakedUSDeVault`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `ClonedCoolDownHolder:rescueTokens` has the `onlyVault` modifier, so it can only be called by the vault. However the `PendlePTKelpVault` and `PendlePTStakedUSDeVault` have no implementation and no way to call the `ClonedCoolDownHolder:rescueTokens` functions.

## Impact

The recovery of lost tokens in the vaults `PendlePTKelpVault` and `PendlePTStakedUSDeVault` can't be done, since the vaults have no way to call the function `ClonedCoolDownHolder:rescueTokens`, which can only be called by the vault. Thus, lost tokens may be stuck in the vault forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing some functionality into the vaults `PendlePTKelpVault` and `PendlePTStakedUSDeVault` to call `ClonedCoolDownHolder:rescueTokens`, so that lost tokens can be recovered by these vaults.
