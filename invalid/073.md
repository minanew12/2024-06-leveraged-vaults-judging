# Protocol could be DOS by transfer error due to lack of code length check

## Summary

The protocol could be DOS due to inadequate handling of transfer errors as it does not perform code length check. As a result, many critical features such as deposit, redemption, and liquidation will be broken, leading to assets being stuck or lost of assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the comment at Lines 312-315 below, the transfer error must be ignored to ensure that the error does not prevent normal vault operations from working. This is crucial because many critical features such as deposit, redemption, and liquidation will revert if the error is not handled properly, which could lead to assets being stuck or loss of assets.

```solidity
File: VaultRewarderLib.sol
311:         if (0 < rewardToClaim) {
312:             // Ignore transfer errors here so that any strange failures here do not
313:             // prevent normal vault operations from working. Failures may include a
314:             // lack of balances or some sort of blacklist that prevents an account
315:             // from receiving tokens.
316:             try IEIP20NonStandard(rewardToken).transfer(account, rewardToClaim) {
317:                 bool success = TokenUtils.checkReturnCode();
318:                 if (success) {
319:                     emit VaultRewardTransfer(rewardToken, account, rewardToClaim);
320:                 } else {
321:                     emit VaultRewardTransfer(rewardToken, account, 0);
322:                 }
323:             // Emits zero tokens transferred if the transfer fails.
324:             } catch {
325:                 emit VaultRewardTransfer(rewardToken, account, 0);
326:             }
327:         }
```

Line 326 above attempts to mitigate the transfer error by "wrapping" the transfer call within the try-catch block. If the `transfer` function reverts, it will not revert the entire transaction and break the critical features of the protocol.

However, this approach was found to be insufficient to mitigate all cases of transfer error. There is still an edge case where an error could occur during transfer, reverting the entire transaction.

If the `rewardToken` points to an address that does not contain any code (codesize == 0), the transaction will revert instead of going into the try-catch block due to how Solidity works. It is possible that some reward tokens may contain self-destruct feature for certain reasons, resulting in the codesize becoming zero at some point in time.

## Impact

If the edge case occurs, many critical features such as deposit, redemption, and liquidation will be broken, leading to assets being stuck or lost of assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the transfer error does not revert the entire transaction under any circumstance. Consider implementing the following changes:

```diff
        if (0 < rewardToClaim) {
            // Ignore transfer errors here so that any strange failures here do not
            // prevent normal vault operations from working. Failures may include a
            // lack of balances or some sort of blacklist that prevents an account
            // from receiving tokens.
+           if (rewardToken.code.length > 0) {}
              try IEIP20NonStandard(rewardToken).transfer(account, rewardToClaim) {
                  bool success = TokenUtils.checkReturnCode();
                  if (success) {
                      emit VaultRewardTransfer(rewardToken, account, rewardToClaim);
                  } else {
                      emit VaultRewardTransfer(rewardToken, account, 0);
                  }
              // Emits zero tokens transferred if the transfer fails.
              } catch {
                  emit VaultRewardTransfer(rewardToken, account, 0);
              }
+           }
        }
```
