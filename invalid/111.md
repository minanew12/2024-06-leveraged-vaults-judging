# Don't check the emission is over when setting new emission rate

## Summary
Don't check the emission is over when setting new emission rate.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
        if (index < settings.numRewardTokens) {
            // Safety check to ensure that the correct token is specified, we can never change the
            // token address once set.
            require(state.rewardToken == rewardToken);
            // Modifies the emission rate on an existing token, direct claims of the token will
            // not be affected by the emission rate.
            // First accumulate under the old regime up to the current time. Even if the previous
            // emissionRatePerYear is zero this will still set the lastAccumulatedTime to the current
            // blockTime.
            _accumulateSecondaryRewardViaEmissionRate(index, state, totalVaultSharesBefore);

            // Save the new emission rates
            state.emissionRatePerYear = emissionRatePerYear;
            if (state.emissionRatePerYear == 0) {
                state.endTime = 0;
            } else {
                require(block.timestamp < endTime);
                state.endTime = endTime;
            }
            VaultStorage.getVaultRewardState()[index] = state;
```
When we want to set new `emissionRatePerYear` or set new `endTime`, it didn't check the old `endTime` is past or not. If the old `endTime` is not past and new `emissionRatePerYear` is set, the account will get wrong rewards.
## Impact
The account's rewards is distributed wrongly in some case.

## Recommendation
```diff
+          require(block.timestamp > state.endTime);
            if (state.emissionRatePerYear == 0) {
                state.endTime = 0;
            } else {
                require(block.timestamp < endTime);
                state.endTime = endTime;
            }
```
