# DOS in `BaseStakingVault::convertStrategyToUnderlying()`

## Summary
In `BaseStakingVault::convertStrategyToUnderlying()` [this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L83) can result in a division by zero which will result in solidity reverts causing DOS
## Vulnerability Detail
In [`BaseStakingVault::convertStrategyToUnderlying()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L69) on line [80](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L80) we can read a comment which says [vaultSharesNotInWithdrawQueue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L81) can be 0, going forward vaultSharesNotInWithdrawQueue is used in to calculate `vaultSharesValue` like this;

`uint256 vaultSharesValue = (vaultSharesNotInWithdrawQueue * stakeAssetPrice * BORROW_PRECISION) /
            (uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION) * Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION);`
so whenever `vaultSharesNotInWithdrawQueue=0` as commented the `vaultSharesValue` will revert because it will be a 0 division which automatically reverts in solidity
## Impact
Division by zero errors will lead to DOS
## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function convertStrategyToUnderlying(
        address account,
        uint256 vaultShares,
        uint256 /* maturity */
    ) public virtual override view returns (int256 underlyingValue) {
        uint256 stakeAssetPrice = uint256(getExchangeRate(0));

        WithdrawRequest memory w = getWithdrawRequest(account);
        uint256 withdrawValue = _calculateValueOfWithdrawRequest(
            w, stakeAssetPrice, BORROW_TOKEN, REDEMPTION_TOKEN
        );
        //@audit
        // This should always be zero if there is a withdraw request.
        uint256 vaultSharesNotInWithdrawQueue = (vaultShares - w.vaultShares);

        //@audit 
        uint256 vaultSharesValue = (vaultSharesNotInWithdrawQueue * stakeAssetPrice * BORROW_PRECISION) /
            (uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION) * Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION);
        return (withdrawValue + vaultSharesValue).toInt();
    }

```

## Recommendation
Implement logic to handle division by zero situations
