# The  `requestId` is never reset back to zero.

## Summary
When an account initiates a withdrawal request in BaseStakingVault.sol `initiateWithdraw()`. The requestId is set from 0 to a new Id lets say 1. However when the withdrawal `finalized`. The state of the requestId stays the same, which leds to many complications as detailed.

## Vulnerability Detail
-  Bob calls `initiateWithdraw()` and receives a requestId.
   since in `Kelp.sol` , `EtherFi.sol`,  and all other dexes in charge of withdrawal dont update.
        `accountWithdraw.requestId = 0`
1. Depositing will not be available for the account since there is a requirment of the account's Id to be zero
2. A vulnerbility of using the same requestId to withdraw tokens in the same exchange or maybe different Exchange is Introduced
3. `finalizeWithdrawsManual` will not go through since the Id is not updated.


## Impact
Depositing will not be available
Using same RequestId may led to loss of funds.
## Code Snippet
**EtherFi.sol**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/EtherFi.sol#L39
```javascript
 
    function _finalizeWithdrawImpl(
        uint256 requestId
    ) internal returns (uint256 tokensClaimed, bool finalized) {
        finalized = _canFinalizeWithdrawRequest(requestId);

        if (finalized) {
            uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
            WithdrawRequestNFT.claimWithdraw(requestId);
            //@audit requestId is never reset back to zero
            tokensClaimed = address(this).balance - balanceBefore;
        }
    }
```
**Ethena.sol**
```javascript
function _finalizeWithdrawImpl(
        uint256 requestId
    ) internal returns (uint256 tokensClaimed, bool finalized) {
        EthenaCooldownHolder holder = EthenaCooldownHolder(
            address(uint160(requestId))
        );
        (tokensClaimed, finalized) = holder.finalizeCooldown();
        //@audit requestId is not reset to 0
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Once withdraw is done the requestId should be rest to zero to allow deposits in the future or avoid using the same Id to withdraw again.
 ```diff
 
    function _finalizeWithdrawImpl(
        uint256 requestId
    ) internal returns (uint256 tokensClaimed, bool finalized) {
        finalized = _canFinalizeWithdrawRequest(requestId);

        if (finalized) {
            uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
            WithdrawRequestNFT.claimWithdraw(requestId);
            //@audit requestId is never reset back to zero
+       address holder = address(uint160(requestId));
+        WithdrawRequest storage accountWithdraw = VaultStorage.getAccountWithdrawRequest()[holder];
+        accountWithdraw.requestId = 0;
            tokensClaimed = address(this).balance - balanceBefore;
        }
    }
```
**Ethena.sol**
```diff
function _finalizeWithdrawImpl(
        uint256 requestId
    ) internal returns (uint256 tokensClaimed, bool finalized) {
        EthenaCooldownHolder holder = EthenaCooldownHolder(
            address(uint160(requestId))
        );
        (tokensClaimed, finalized) = holder.finalizeCooldown();
       if (finalized){

+        accountWithdraw.requestId = 0;
       }
        //@audit requestId is not reset to 0
    }
    and all other dexes....
