# _calculateBaseToQuote() doesn't check the roundID

## Summary
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact
Inside PendlePTOracle.sol we have 

      function _calculateBaseToQuote() internal view returns (
          uint80 roundId,
          int256 answer,
          uint256 startedAt,
          uint256 updatedAt,
          uint80 answeredInRound
      ) {
        _checkSequencer();

        int256 baseToUSD;
        (
            roundId,
            baseToUSD,
            startedAt,
            updatedAt,
            answeredInRound
        ) = baseToUSDOracle.latestRoundData();
        require(baseToUSD > 0, "Chainlink Rate Error");
        // Overflow and div by zero not possible
        if (invertBase) baseToUSD = (baseToUSDDecimals * baseToUSDDecimals) / baseToUSD;

        // Past expiration, hardcode the PT oracle price to 1. It is no longer tradable and
        // is worth 1 unit of the underlying SY at expiration.
        int256 ptRate = expiry <= block.timestamp ? ptDecimals : _getPTRate();

        answer = (ptRate * baseToUSD * rateDecimals) /
            (baseToUSDDecimals * ptDecimals);
    }
    
    As we can see there is no check of the roundID therefore we can inaccurate results.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Answered in round ID should be the same as the round ID
require(answeredInRound == roundId, "Chainlink Rate Error");
