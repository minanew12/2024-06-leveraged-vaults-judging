# Lido withdraw limitation will brick the withdraw process in an edge case

## Summary
Lido protocol has limitation regarding the requestWithdraw function. However some of these limitation have not been considered in the `_initiateWithdrawImpl` leading to users being unable to claim their vault shares even after the cooldown.
## Vulnerability Detail
Lido has stated the following withdraw limitation in their docs:
1. withdrawals must not be paused
2. stETH balance of msg.sender must be greater than the sum of all _amounts
3. there must be approval from the msg.sender to this contract address for the overall amount of stETH token transfer
4. each amount in _amounts must be greater than MIN_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT and lower than MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT (values that can be changed by the DAO)
Extracted from here( https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721#requestwithdrawals )


Consider the following scenario:
 1) A user who has shares representing stETH less than the MIN_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT or more than the MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT calls `initiateWithdraw`. The withdraw will be initiated successfully and the rsETH to withdraw will be sent to the holder contract which is going to start the cooldown.
 2) However after the cooldown has passed the user will call the `triggerExtraStep` function which will always result in revert because of the Lido requirements regarding the amount to be withdrawn(mentioned in point 4). 
## Impact
The user will experience a full DOS of the protocol. They will have a pending withdraw that will never finish, which will result in their funds being locked forever. They will not be able to liquidate or deposit because of the pending withdraw. The function `triggerExtraStep` will always revert and the tokens from Kelp will never be claimed, because of Lido's limitation. - High

## Recommendation
Consider enforcing withdraw limitations so that if a user has more than the MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT split it on two requests, or create deposit limitations.
