# Storage of contracts might be corrupted during upgrading

## Summary
Storage of contracts might be corrupted during upgrading.
## Vulnerability Detail
During the upgrade, the storage of contracts such as `PendlePTKelpVault.sol` may be corrupted.
Let's take the `PendlePTKelpVault.sol` contract as an example. The following is the inheritance of the contract
Note: The contracts highlighted in Orange mean that there are no gap slots defined. The contracts highlighted in Green mean that gap slots have been defined

We can see that it is not safe to upgrade. Without gaps, adding new storage variables to any of these contracts could overwrite the beginning of the child contract storage layout, causing the system to misbehave drastically.
## Impact
Storage of contracts might be corrupted during upgrading.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider defining an appropriate storage gap in each upgradeable parent contract at the end of all the storage variable definitions as follows:
```js

uint256[50] private __gap; // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions
```
