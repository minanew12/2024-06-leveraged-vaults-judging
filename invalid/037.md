# Owner can steal all tokens

## Summary
Note: I don't know if this is can be classified as single vulnerbility or separate vulnerbilities . therefore i have written both issues in one, if its double please mark it as double : )

1. owner can pass his account in `updateAccountRewards()` as his own address manipulate vaultShares and totalVaultSharesBefore to claim all tokens . and since there is no check if the owner gave correct details `_claimAccountRewards` will be called and send all the rewards to the `owner`.
2. `updateAccountRewards` an owner can set the `vaultShares` to be to high and `IsMint` false. and since there is no method of verification of the data called by the owner an account can lose its Rewards.



## Vulnerability Detail
**vulnerbility all rewards send to the owner**
- Owner calls `updateAccountRewards` as :
                1. account being owners address, 
                2. VaultShares being the remainder to the total amounts in vault
                3. isMint as false so as to add before + now
                4. `claimAccountRewards()` is called and 
- all amounts sent to the owner.

**vulnerbility account loses its reward**
1. Owner call `updateAccountRewards` with high unverified number. 
2. `_claimAccountRewads()` is called internally with 0 as the vaultShares before and after
5. account is sent rewards 0

## Impact
Accounts will lose all there rewards.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/common/VaultRewarderLib.sol#L212
```javascript
    function updateAccountRewards(
        address account,
        uint256 vaultShares,
        uint256 totalVaultSharesBefore,
        bool isMint
    ) external {
       //@audit vaultShares, isMint, totalVaults is never validated which is a sign of too much power.
       //@audit no check if msg.sender != account meaning owner can update own account.
        require(msg.sender == address(Deployments.NOTIONAL));
        uint256 vaultSharesBefore = _getVaultSharesBefore(account);
        _claimAccountRewards(
            account,
            totalVaultSharesBefore,
            vaultSharesBefore,
            isMint
                ? vaultSharesBefore + vaultShares
                : vaultSharesBefore - vaultShares
        );
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. to avoid owner updating his own account. check 
```javascript
   if (msg.sender == account){
        revert("cannot update own account")
   }
```
2. add checks to verify isMint is either true or false. and checks to check the validity of vaultShares adn totalVaultShareBefore3
