# Ethena::_sellStakedUSDe will revert due to not setting approvals to called DEX

## Summary

`Ethena::_sellStakedUSDe` interacts with DEXs however has no functionality to set approvals for these DEXs, whilst contracts utilising this library also do not set these approvals. This will lead to a revert when trying to utilise this functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
[Ethena::_sellStakedUSDe()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/Ethena.sol#L124-L167)
```solidity
    function _sellStakedUSDe(
        uint256 sUSDeAmount,
        address borrowToken,
        uint256 minPurchaseAmount,
        bytes memory exchangeData,
        uint16 dexId
    ) internal returns (uint256 borrowedCurrencyAmount) {
        Trade memory sDAITrade = Trade({
            tradeType: TradeType.EXACT_IN_SINGLE,
            sellToken: address(sUSDe),
            buyToken: address(sDAI),
            amount: sUSDeAmount,
            limit: 0, // NOTE: no slippage guard is set here, it is enforced in the second leg
                      // of the trade.
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            exchangeData: abi.encode(CurveV2Adapter.CurveV2SingleData({
                pool: 0x167478921b907422F8E88B43C4Af2B8BEa278d3A,
                fromIndex: 1, // sUSDe
                toIndex: 0 // sDAI
            }))
        });
...SKIP...
        if (borrowToken != address(DAI)) {
            Trade memory trade = Trade({
                tradeType: TradeType.EXACT_IN_SINGLE,
                sellToken: address(DAI),
                buyToken: borrowToken,
                amount: daiAmount,
                limit: minPurchaseAmount,
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                exchangeData: exchangeData
            });

            // Trades the unwrapped DAI back to the given token.
            (/* */, borrowedCurrencyAmount) = trade._executeTrade(dexId);
        } else {
            borrowedCurrencyAmount = daiAmount;
        }
    }
```
When calling `_executeTrade` on the `TradeHandler.sol` library, approvals need to be set before to allow the DEXs to transferFrom tokens during the operation. The `Ethena` Library does not manage these approvals, and the function `_sellStakeUSD` is utilised by [EthenaVault::_executeInstantRedemption()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/EthenaVault.sol#L99-L112) which also does not set these approvals:
```solidity
    function _executeInstantRedemption(
        address /* account */,
        uint256 vaultShares,
        uint256 /* maturity */,
        RedeemParams memory params
    ) internal override returns (uint256 borrowedCurrencyAmount) {
        uint256 sUSDeToSell = getStakingTokensForVaultShare(vaultShares);

        // Selling sUSDe requires special handling since most of the liquidity
        // sits inside a sUSDe/sDAI pool on Curve.
>>      return EthenaLib._sellStakedUSDe(
            sUSDeToSell, BORROW_TOKEN, params.minPurchaseAmount, params.exchangeData, params.dexId
        );
    }
```
Neither `EthenaVault.sol` or the inherited `BaseStakingVault.sol` contract contain these approval functions. The fact that `EthenaVault.sol` heavily utilises the `Ethena.sol` library should lead to this issue being as in-scope, with sponsor confirmation on Discord:

>The Ethena lib is in scope so I think that is acceptable

## Impact

The lack of approvals being set for the DEXs that are being utilised for selling staked `USDe` will lead to reverts, breaking functionality of the code resulting in a Medium risk issue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set an unlimited approval from the Ethena contract to the utilised DEXs or add an approval call to set the exact approval that will be traded before the trade occurs.
