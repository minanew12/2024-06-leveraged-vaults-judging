# When call `_splitWithdrawRequest`, It has not been checked about _from's remaing vaultShares.

## Summary
When call `_splitWithdrawRequest`, It has not been checked about _from's remaing `vaultShares`.

## Vulnerability Detail
That is, `_to` can take more values ​​than `_from`'s vaultShares. And since `_from` is a negative number, additional damage occurs.

## Impact
A malicious call can increase the `vaultShares` value of `_to` to infinity(? -- max range of data type).
By making the `valueShare` value of `_from` negative, it can cause inconsistencies and errors in all future calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You must check whether `w.vaultShares` is greater than `valueShare`.
for example `require(w.vaultShares > valueShare)`
