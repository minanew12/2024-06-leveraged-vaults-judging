# Multiple Invocations on claimRewardTokens Function Leading to Over-Distribution of Rewards

## Summary

The `claimRewardTokens` function in the smart contract is susceptible to over-distribution of rewards due to concurrent invocations. This vulnerability can deplete the reward pool faster than intended, resulting in improper reward claims and financial discrepancies.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `claimRewardTokens` function is intended to claim all rewards for the entire vault and update the accumulators. It can be called by any address except the Notional contract. While this design offers flexibility, it introduces a significant vulnerability:

Race Conditions

- **Concurrent Executions**: When multiple users call `claimRewardTokens` simultaneously, race conditions may occur. The function relies on the current state of `totalVaultSharesBefore`, which can be altered by concurrent executions.
- **Inconsistent State Updates**: Race conditions can lead to inconsistent state updates, causing some calls to read stale data and others to update accumulators based on outdated information.

Improper Handling in `_claimVaultRewards`

- **Concurrent Invocations**: The `_claimVaultRewards` function calculates and distributes rewards. If multiple calls are made to `claimRewardTokens` simultaneously, `_claimVaultRewards` may be invoked concurrently, leading to miscalculations.
- **Misallocation of Rewards**: This can result in over-claiming or under-claiming rewards, as accumulators may not accurately reflect the total vault shares or the correct reward amounts.

## Impact

The primary impact of this vulnerability is the over-distribution of rewards from the reward pool, which can lead to:

- **Depletion of Reward Pool**: Rapid depletion, leaving insufficient rewards for future claimants.
- **Financial Loss**: Financial losses for stakeholders due to improper reward distribution.
- **Inaccurate Reward Tracking**: Difficulty in tracking and auditing rewards, leading to potential disputes and loss of trust in the system.

 Reproduction Steps

1. Deploy the smart contract with the `claimRewardTokens` function.
2. Ensure the contract has an active reward pool with sufficient rewards.
3. Simulate multiple users calling `claimRewardTokens` simultaneously.
4. Observe the state of the reward pool and the distributed rewards.
Example Scenario Initial State

- Total reward pool: 1,000,000 tokens
- Total vault shares: 10,000 shares
- Each share is initially entitled to 100 tokens

Concurrent Calls

- User A and User B both call `claimRewardTokens` simultaneously.
- Due to race conditions, both users' calls read the initial state where each share is entitled to 100 tokens.
- Both calls update the accumulators based on the initial state, leading to each share being rewarded 100 tokens twice.
 Resulting State

- Total reward claimed: 2,000,000 tokens (double the available reward pool)
- Reward pool depleted prematurely

```solidity
    /// @notice Claims all the rewards for the entire vault and updates the accumulators. Does not
    /// update emission rewarders since those are automatically updated on every account claim.
    function claimRewardTokens() external {
        // Ensures that this method is not called from inside a vault account action.
        require(msg.sender != address(Deployments.NOTIONAL));
        // This method is not executed from inside enter or exit vault positions, so this total
        // vault shares value is valid.
        uint256 totalVaultSharesBefore = VaultStorage.getStrategyVaultState().totalVaultSharesGlobal;
        (VaultRewardState[] memory state, , RewardPoolStorage memory rewardPool) = getRewardSettings();
        _claimVaultRewards(totalVaultSharesBefore, state, rewardPool);
    }
