# EtherFiLib_initiateWithdrawImpl approve to wrong address lead to withdraw fail

## Summary
Issue High: EtherFiLib_initiateWithdrawImpl approve to wrong address lead to withdraw fail

## Vulnerability Detail

In the contract EtherFiLib.sol, the function `_initiateWithdrawImpl` approve to wrong address which will lead to withdraw fail

`_initiateWithdrawImpl` approve `eETHReceived` eEth to address `LiquidityPool`

[EtherFiLib](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/EtherFi.sol#L24-L27)
```solidity
function _initiateWithdrawImpl(uint256 weETHToUnwrap) internal returns (uint256 requestId) {
    uint256 eETHReceived = weETH.unwrap(weETHToUnwrap);
    eETH.approve(address(LiquidityPool), eETHReceived);
    return LiquidityPool.requestWithdraw(address(this), eETHReceived);
}
```

and in `LiquidityPool.requestWithdraw` , eETH will transferFrom sender to withdrawRequestNFT , which will fail due to not approved 

[LiquidityPool](https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/smart-contracts/blob/master/src/LiquidityPool.sol#L202-L214)
```solidity
function requestWithdraw(address recipient, uint256 amount) public whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
    uint256 share = sharesForAmount(amount);
    if (amount > type(uint96).max || amount == 0 || share == 0) revert InvalidAmount();

    // transfer shares to WithdrawRequestNFT contract from this contract
    eETH.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(withdrawRequestNFT), amount);

    uint256 requestId = withdrawRequestNFT.requestWithdraw(uint96(amount), uint96(share), recipient, 0);
   
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, recipient, amount, SourceOfFunds.EETH);

    return requestId;
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

change the function to 

```solidity

function _initiateWithdrawImpl(uint256 weETHToUnwrap) internal returns (uint256 requestId) {
    uint256 eETHReceived = weETH.unwrap(weETHToUnwrap);
    eETH.approve(address(WithdrawRequestNFT), eETHReceived);
    return LiquidityPool.requestWithdraw(address(this), eETHReceived);
}

```
