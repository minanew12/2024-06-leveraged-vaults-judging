# in `PendlePTOracle::_calculateBaseToQuote()` the function expects to return `answeredInRound` which is Deprecated

## Summary
answeredInRound:  Deprecated - Previously used when answers could take multiple rounds to be computed
## Vulnerability Detail
`latestRoundData()` and `_calculateBaseToQuote()` functions in `PendlePTOracle.sol` are expected to return `answeredInRound`, which, according to the Chainlink documentation, is deprecated.
## Impact
 The function might still work as is for now, but future versions of Chainlink might remove answeredInRound, leading to potential compatibility issues.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/oracles/PendlePTOracle.sol#L97
```solodity
  function latestRoundData() external view override returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    ) {
        return _calculateBaseToQuote();
    }

```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I didn't find an alternative property or method instead of `answeredInRound` in Chanlink documentation.  

Update Your Function: Modify the function to either exclude answeredInRound or replace it with the new recommended method or property.
