# Some rewards will be struck in contract because of rounding down

## Summary
Some rewards will be struck in contract because of rounding down.
## Vulnerability Detail
Accumulate reward is via claiming or emission rate. The calculation of `accumulatedRewardPerVaultShare` is calculated by rounding down.
```solidity
        state.accumulatedRewardPerVaultShare +=
            ((tokensClaimed * uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION)) / totalVaultSharesBefore).toUint128();
```
```solidity
            additionalIncentiveAccumulatedPerVaultShare =
                (timeSinceLastAccumulation
                    * uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION)
                    * state.emissionRatePerYear)
                / (Constants.YEAR * totalVaultSharesBefore);
```
So there will be some rewards struck in contract. 
## Impact
Some rewards will be struck in contract.

## Recommendation
Add function to let owner move the excess rewards to protocol's vault.
Or use [openzeppelin library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol).
