# `minAmountOut` set to 0 in `_redeemPT()` can cause loss of funds through redemption

## Summary
In the contract `PendlePrincipalToken.sol`, function `_redeemPT()` is used for PT redemption whether it is expired or not.

This function redeems `netSyOut` amount of shares for `TOKEN_OUT_SY` but the function is passing in a hardcoded `0` in the `minTokenOut` Param

## Vulnerability Detail

The function is : 

```solidity
function _redeemPT(uint256 vaultShares) internal returns (uint256 netTokenOut) {
        uint256 netPtIn = getStakingTokensForVaultShare(vaultShares);
        uint256 netSyOut;

        // PT tokens are known to be ERC20 compatible
        if (PT.isExpired()) {
            PT.transfer(address(YT), netPtIn);
            netSyOut = YT.redeemPY(address(SY));
        } else {
            PT.transfer(address(MARKET), netPtIn);
            (netSyOut, ) = MARKET.swapExactPtForSy(address(SY), netPtIn, "");
        }

        netTokenOut = SY.redeem(address(this), netSyOut, TOKEN_OUT_SY, 0, true);
    }
```

Here the code first gets `netSyOut` and then redeems it for `TOKEN_OUT_SY` through this code

```solidity
    netTokenOut = SY.redeem(address(this), netSyOut, TOKEN_OUT_SY, 0, true);
```

The 0 here is used for `minTokenOut` which is a slippage parameter. This causes the trade to execute even on lower than estimated/desired returns which causes loss of funds on the redemption.

`minTokenOut` should be used so that the function reverts in situations where the price has changed which can be done by external users (changing the reservers through flashloans etc.)

## Impact

Loss of funds when redeeming.
