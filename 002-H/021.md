# Missing check for slippage in the _executeInstantRedemption function will result in a loss of funds

## Summary
The `_executeInstantRedemption` function in PendlePrincipalToken.sol does not include a slippage check when the `BORROW_TOKEN` is `TOKEN_OUT_SY`.

## Vulnerability Detail
There's a slippage check when the `BORROW_TOKEN` is not equal to `TOKEN_OUT_SY` in the `_executeInstantRedemption` function.
However, when the `BORROW_TOKEN` is `TOKEN_OUT_SY`, the slippage check is missing.
This can result in a loss of funds when the `BORROW_TOKEN` is `TOKEN_OUT_SY`.
`_executeInstantRedemption` function is called from `redeemFromNotional` when the user wants to exit from the vault and redeem their funds.

## Impact
Users can suffer a loss of funds due to front-running sandwich attacks or other types of price manipulation.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the slippage check when the `BORROW_TOKEN` is `TOKEN_OUT_SY` in the `_executeInstantRedemption` function to avoid potential loss of funds.
