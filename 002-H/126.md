# Lack of slippage protection

## Summary

The `minTokenOut` for `PendlePrincipalToken._redeemPT()` is specified as zero. The expected approach for integration with external protocols is to let the user specify his slippage tolerance.

## Vulnerability Detail

`PendlePrincipalToken._redeemPT()` will be called by `PendlePrincipalToken._initiateWithdrawImpl()` and `PendlePrincipalToken._executeInstantRedemption()` . These calls will originate from `BaseStakingVault.initiateWithdraw()`, `BaseStakingVault.forceWithdraw()` and `BaseStakingVault._redeemFromNotional()`. Therefore, withdrawing/redeeming tokens from `BaseStakingVault` will be impacted due to the current zero value.

## Impact

In adversarial market conditions users might be getting zero tokens when withdrawing/redeeming and lose their funds.

## Recommendation

Convert the slippage to be a user input for withdraw/redeem flows.
