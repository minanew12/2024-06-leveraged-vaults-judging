# PendlePrincipleToken::_redeemPT is prone to fees and slippage, but contains no limiting parameters

## Summary

`PendlePrincipleToken::_redeemPT` calls `MARKET.swapExactPtForSy` which contains a fee system that is variable depending on market conditions. This combined with no slippage controls for users can lead to users suffering losses amounting to multiple $ amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
[PendlePrincipalToken::_redeemPT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/PendlePrincipalToken.sol#L124-L138)
```solidity
    function _redeemPT(uint256 vaultShares) internal returns (uint256 netTokenOut) {
        uint256 netPtIn = getStakingTokensForVaultShare(vaultShares);
        uint256 netSyOut;

        // PT tokens are known to be ERC20 compatible
        if (PT.isExpired()) {
            PT.transfer(address(YT), netPtIn);
            netSyOut = YT.redeemPY(address(SY));
        } else {
            PT.transfer(address(MARKET), netPtIn);
>>          (netSyOut, ) = MARKET.swapExactPtForSy(address(SY), netPtIn, "");
        }

>>      netTokenOut = SY.redeem(address(this), netSyOut, TOKEN_OUT_SY, 0, true);
    }
```
When `_redeemPT` is redeeming a `PT` that is not expired it performs a swap using `MARKET.swapExactPtForSy` which contains fees:
[Example 1](https://app.blocksec.com/explorer/tx/eth/0xc81c1ce83775f312bea3ac01ffdd553a55f65defacda847f0a2f604cd6158be4?line=34&debugLine=34)
`exactPtIn = 20153371981443194691977`
`netSyOut = 19922736359016291261095`
`netSyFee = 12135357357042692703`
`Total fee = 0.06%`


[Example 2](https://app.blocksec.com/explorer/tx/eth/0x019544855d29a008f443782f2b5e47fc23884c9b78ee99d0cfb4a681f02c3c31?line=76&debugLine=76)
`exactPtIn = 47147595942665245404375`
`netSyOut = 46135904910505055234436`
`netSyFee = 38448432540537129843`
`Total fee = 0.081%`

As seen there is a fee associated with the call to `swapExactPtForSy` and this fee can vary. This fact coupled with passing `0` minimum amount to `netTokenOut = SY.redeem(address(this), netSyOut, TOKEN_OUT_SY, 0, true);` means that slippage and fee factors are not considered and can lead to unfavourable losses.

```solidity
    function _initiateWithdrawImpl(
        address account, uint256 vaultSharesToRedeem, bool isForced
    ) internal override returns (uint256 requestId) {
        // When doing a direct withdraw for PTs, we first redeem or trade out of the PT
        // and then initiate a withdraw on the TOKEN_OUT_SY. Since the vault shares are
        // stored in PT terms, we pass tokenOutSy terms (i.e. weETH or sUSDe) to the withdraw
        // implementation.
        uint256 tokenOutSy = _redeemPT(vaultSharesToRedeem);
        requestId = _initiateSYWithdraw(account, tokenOutSy, isForced);
        // Store the tokenOutSy here for later when we do a valuation check against the position
        VaultStorage.getWithdrawRequestData()[requestId] = abi.encode(tokenOutSy);
    }
```
In the `_initiateWithdrawImpl()` there is a call to `_redeemPT()` however there is no minimum amount out check either.

## Impact

Fees and slippage factors that can change depending on market factors are not being considered and managed when redeeming tokens. This can lead to users receiving higher fees, which might be small per user but will add up across all users and lead to value leak across the protocol.

Depending on the size of the redeemed position, this % can equal multiple $.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a slippage parameter than is controlled by a user to allow them to limit any fee/ slippage losses due to market conditions.
