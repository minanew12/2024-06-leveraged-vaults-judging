# The _redeemPT function lacks slippage protection.

## Summary
The _redeemPT function lacks slippage protection.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
   function _redeemPT(uint256 vaultShares) internal returns (uint256 netTokenOut) {
        uint256 netPtIn = getStakingTokensForVaultShare(vaultShares);
        uint256 netSyOut;

        // PT tokens are known to be ERC20 compatible
        if (PT.isExpired()) {
            PT.transfer(address(YT), netPtIn);
            netSyOut = YT.redeemPY(address(SY));
        } else {
            PT.transfer(address(MARKET), netPtIn);
@>>            (netSyOut, ) = MARKET.swapExactPtForSy(address(SY), netPtIn, "");//@audit no slippage protected 
        }

        netTokenOut = SY.redeem(address(this), netSyOut, TOKEN_OUT_SY, 0, true);
    }
```
MARKET is Pendleâ€™s AMM market, where prices can be manipulated. We can see that when trading PT for SY, there is no check on netSyOut. This could result in receiving very little SY due to market manipulation.

## Impact
The lack of slippage protection results in a loss of funds for users.

## Recommendation
Add slippage protection to the _redeemPT function, similar to the functions in PENDLE_ROUTER
