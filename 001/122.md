# Potential Risk of Unchecked Slippage Guard in _sellStakedUSDe

## Summary
The _sellStakedUSDe function facilitates the exchange of staked USDe tokens (sUSDe) for DAI and subsequently for another token. However, it lacks a proper slippage guard when trading sUSDe to DAI, potentially exposing users to adverse price movements.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function _sellStakedUSDe executes two trades sequentially: first from sUSDe to DAI and then potentially from DAI to another token (borrowToken). The initial trade from sUSDe to DAI lacks a slippage guard, which ensures that the trade executes within an acceptable price range relative to the expected rate.

- Loss of Value: Without a slippage guard, the trade from sUSDe to DAI could execute at a significantly worse rate during volatile market conditions, resulting in financial losses for users.
- Arbitrage Exploitation: Malicious actors could exploit price discrepancies between exchanges or during market fluctuations, potentially manipulating the trade execution to their advantage.

## Impact
1. Alice has 100 sUSDe tokens.
2. Bob intends to exchange DAI for another token using _sellStakedUSDe.
3. Alice calls _sellStakedUSDe with sUSDeAmount = 100, borrowToken = TokenX, and minPurchaseAmount = 0.
4. The function executes the trade from sUSDe to DAI without checking slippage.
5. Malicious Bob monitors the transaction and front-runs Alice by manipulating the DAI exchange rate during the trade execution.

Due to the absence of a slippage guard, Alice receives fewer DAI tokens than expected.
Bob profits from the manipulated trade, exploiting Alice's transaction without proper price protection.

## Recommendation
Implement a slippage guard in the _sellStakedUSDe function to ensure trades from sUSDe to DAI execute within an acceptable price range. This will safeguard users against adverse market conditions and potential arbitrage exploits.
