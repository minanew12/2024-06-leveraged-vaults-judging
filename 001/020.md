# Missing check for slippage in the _sellStakedUSDe function will result in a loss of funds


## Summary
The `_sellStakedUSDe` function in Ethena.sol does not include a slippage check when the `borrowToken` is DAI.
This can result in a loss of funds if the price of `sUSDE/sDAI` changes.

## Vulnerability Detail
There's a slippage check when the `borrowToken` is not equal to `DAI` in the `_sellStakedUSDe` function.
However, when the `borrowToken` is `DAI`, the slippage check is missing. This can result in a loss of funds if the price of `sUSDE/sDAI` changes.
`_sellStakedUSDe` function is called when the user wants to exit from the vault and redeem their funds.

## Impact
If the price of `sUSDE/sDAI` changes, the user will receive less `DAI` than expected, resulting in a loss of funds.

## Recommendation
To avoid potential loss of funds when the `borrowToken` is `DAI`, it is advised to include a slippage check in the `_sellStakedUSDe` function.
