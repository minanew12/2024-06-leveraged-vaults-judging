# Slippage protection not handled in `Ethena::_sellStakedUSDe()`

## Summary

Slippage protection not handled in [Ethena::_sellStakedUSDe()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/Ethena.sol#L136)

## Vulnerability Detail

By enforcing slippage limits, the contract ensures that the trade only executes if the price is within an acceptable range, thus protecting the user's funds from drastic market movements.


## Impact

Without slippage protection, a trade might execute at a significantly worse rate than anticipated. For instance, if the market price of `sDAI` changes rapidly or if the liquidity in the pool is insufficient, the user might end up receiving much less `sDAI` for their `sUSDe` than expected.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/Ethena.sol#L136

```javascript
function _sellStakedUSDe(
    uint256 sUSDeAmount,
    address borrowToken,
    uint256 minPurchaseAmount,
    bytes memory exchangeData,
    uint16 dexId
) internal returns (uint256 borrowedCurrencyAmount) {
    Trade memory sDAITrade = Trade({
        tradeType: TradeType.EXACT_IN_SINGLE,
        sellToken: address(sUSDe),
        buyToken: address(sDAI),
        amount: sUSDeAmount,
@>      limit: 0, // NOTE: no slippage guard is set here, it is enforced in the second leg
                    // of the trade.
        deadline: block.timestamp, // @audit - why no slippage?
        exchangeData: abi.encode(CurveV2Adapter.CurveV2SingleData({
            pool: 0x167478921b907422F8E88B43C4Af2B8BEa278d3A,
            fromIndex: 1, // sUSDe
            toIndex: 0 // sDAI
        }))
    });

    ...
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A slippage limit can be set by defining a minimum acceptable amount of `sDAI` that must be received for the trade to proceed. If the actual amount of `sDAI` that would be received falls below this threshold, the trade would revert, thereby protecting the user from executing the trade at an unfavorable rate.


In this implementation, the `minSDAIAmount` parameter is added to ensure the trade from `sUSDe` to `sDAI` only proceeds if the amount of `sDAI` received is above the specified minimum threshold, thereby protecting against slippage.


```diff
function _sellStakedUSDe(
    uint256 sUSDeAmount,
    address borrowToken,
    uint256 minPurchaseAmount,
    bytes memory exchangeData,
    uint16 dexId,
+   uint256 minSDAIAmount // Added slippage protection parameter
) internal returns (uint256 borrowedCurrencyAmount) {
    Trade memory sDAITrade = Trade({
        tradeType: TradeType.EXACT_IN_SINGLE,
        sellToken: address(sUSDe),
        buyToken: address(sDAI),
        amount: sUSDeAmount,
-       limit: 0,
+       limit: minSDAIAmount, // Added slippage guard
        deadline: block.timestamp,
        exchangeData: abi.encode(CurveV2Adapter.CurveV2SingleData({
            pool: 0x167478921b907422F8E88B43C4Af2B8BEa278d3A,
            fromIndex: 1, // sUSDe
            toIndex: 0 // sDAI
        }))
    });
    ...
}
```
