# Missing slippage protection in `Ethena:_sellStakedUSDe`

## Summary

Slippage protection inside the function `Ethena:_sellStakedUSDe` may not be done in the case where the borrowToken is `DAI`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `Ethena:_sellStakedUSDe` may execute up to 2 trades by calling `_executeTrade()` on line 146 and 163 in Ethena.sol.

The trade params for the first trade are missing slippage protection (line 136 Ethena.sol) with the comment that the slippage protection will be done in the 2nd trade, where the `minPurchaseAmount` is used to protect against slippage (line 157 Ethena.sol).

However, the 2nd trade is only done if `borrowToken != address(DAI)` (line 151 Ethena.sol). This means that if the `borrowToken` is DAI, there is no slippage protection applied and the unwrapped `daiAmount` received from the first trade is assigned to the return value `borrowedCurrencyAmount` (line 165 Ethena.sol).

## Impact

When a victim account exits a vault, an attacker might execute a sandwich attack to manipulate the price, so that the victim will suffer a loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing some slippage protection for the case where the `borrowToken` is DAI.

```solidity
// Ethena.sol
164        } else {
+ 165          require(minPurchaseAmount >= sDAIAmount);    
166            borrowedCurrencyAmount = daiAmount;
167        }
```
