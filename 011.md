# Redeemtion can be locked forever if recipient is a contract

## Summary
Redeemtion can be locked forever if recipient is a contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `BaseStrategyVault.sol#redeemFromNotional()` function allows users to redeem underlying assets, such as ETH or an ERC20 token through the `Notional` proxy.

When the underlying asset is ETH, the `redeemFromNotional()` function sends the ETH using the low-level transfer() function:

```solidity
195:    if (_UNDERLYING_IS_ETH) {
196:        if (transferToReceiver > 0) payable(receiver).transfer(transferToReceiver);
197:        if (transferToNotional > 0) payable(address(NOTIONAL)).transfer(transferToNotional);
198:    }
```

However, transfer() only forwards 2300 gas, which is not enough for the recipient to execute any non-trivial logic in a receive() or fallback function. For instance, it is not enough for Safes (such as this one in use by the protocol) to receive funds, which require > 6k gas for the call to reach the implementation contract and emit an event:

If the `receiver` is the contract account like a multisig or smart contract wallet that has a receive() function requiring >2300 gas, their subsequent `redeemFromNotional()` call will fail permanently. The withdrawn ETH will be locked in the WithdrawQueue contract forever, leading to loss of funds.

Proof of Concept
1.Alice sets the `receiver` to her multisig wallet contract to withdraw 10 ETH worth of the debt. The multisig contract is the `receiver`.
2.Alice tries to call `redeemFromNotional()`. However, the multisig has a receive() function that uses >2300 gas.
3.When `redeemFromNotional()` executes #L195~#L198, the multisigâ€™s receive() fails due to out of gas, and the transaction reverts.
The 10 ETH is now permanently locked in `BaseStakingVault`, with no way for Alice to redeem it.

The sponsor, @Jeff Wu | Notional metioned that the issue that appear in the `BaseStrategyVault` is valid because the `BaseStakingVault` is inherited from the `BaseStrategyVault`.

## Impact
The redeemtion funds can be locked forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use call() instead of transfer() to send ETH in `redeemFromNotional()`:

```solidity
    (bool success, ) = payable(receiver).call{value: transferToReceiver}("");
    require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
```
This forwards all available gas and allows contract recipients to execute arbitrary logic.
