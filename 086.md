# Front-runable initializer

## Summary
The contract initializer lacks access controls, allowing anyone to initialize it. This vulnerability enables malicious users to front-run the initialize() call with incorrect parameters.
## Vulnerability Detail
If the initializer is not executed in the same transaction as the constructor, a malicious user can front-run the initialize() call, forcing the contract to be redeployed.
contract initializer is missing access controls, allowing users to initialize the contract. By front-running the contract deployers to initialize the contract, the incorrect parameters may be supplied, leaving the contract needing redeployed. 
## Impact
High risk of misconfiguration, requiring contract redeployment.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L60
```
 function initialize(string memory name, uint16 borrowCurrencyId) public virtual initializer {
        __INIT_VAULT(name, borrowCurrencyId);
        // Double check to ensure that these tokens are matching
        require(BORROW_TOKEN == address(_underlyingToken()));

        _initialize();
    }
```
initialize function does not have access control. That is vulnerable to front-running.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Setting the owner in the contract's constructor to the ``` msg.sender ``` and adding the ```onlyOwner``` modifier to all initializers would be a sufficient level of access control.
