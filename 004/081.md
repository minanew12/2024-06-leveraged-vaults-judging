# A failed rewardToken transfer results in a loss for the user


## Summary
A failed rewardToken transfer results in a loss for the user
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
function _claimRewardToken(
        address rewardToken,
        address account,
        uint256 vaultSharesBefore,
        uint256 vaultSharesAfter,
        uint256 rewardsPerVaultShare
    ) internal returns (uint256 rewardToClaim) {
        rewardToClaim = _getRewardsToClaim(
            rewardToken, account, vaultSharesBefore, rewardsPerVaultShare
        );

@>        VaultStorage.getAccountRewardDebt()[rewardToken][account] = (
            (vaultSharesAfter * rewardsPerVaultShare) /
                uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION)
        );

        if (0 < rewardToClaim) {
            // Ignore transfer errors here so that any strange failures here do not
            // prevent normal vault operations from working. Failures may include a
            // lack of balances or some sort of blacklist that prevents an account
            // from receiving tokens.
@>            try IEIP20NonStandard(rewardToken).transfer(account, rewardToClaim) {
                bool success = TokenUtils.checkReturnCode();
                if (success) {
                    emit VaultRewardTransfer(rewardToken, account, rewardToClaim);
                } else {
                    emit VaultRewardTransfer(rewardToken, account, 0);
                }
            // Emits zero tokens transferred if the transfer fails.
            } catch {
                emit VaultRewardTransfer(rewardToken, account, 0);
            }
        }
    }
```
Although the developer mentions in the comments, “Ignore transfer errors here so that any strange failures do not prevent normal vault operations from working,” this can result in losses for the user. For example, due to a lack of balances, the user might not receive the rewards, but the accounting will have already recorded that the user has received these rewards.
## Impact
A failed rewardToken transfer results in a loss for the user

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only update the accounting of user's rewards if the rewardToken transfer is successful.
