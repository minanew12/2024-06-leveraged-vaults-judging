# deadline set to as block.timestamp is a dangerous parameter

## Summary
Lack of slippage due to deadline set to as block.timestamp

## Vulnerability Detail
User's who want to exit from the vault, they  need to redeem their amount by calling [`_redeemFromNotional`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L136).
While redeeming the redeemtion is done by two ways , 
1.[`_executeInstantRedemption`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L152)
2.[`_redeemActiveWithdrawRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L157) 
The problem is both of them before executing the trade sets the deadline parameter in [Trade](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L170) as block.timestamp ,  since block.timestamp is the time when the function is executed. The transaction can be sitting in the mempool & executed after a long time.
This can be done easily via a MEV. A MEV bot detects the pending transaction. Since the outdated maximum slippage value now allows for high slippage, the bot sandwiches a user, resulting in significant profit for the bot and significant loss for the user. 
Thus meaning a user could see less amount redeemed than their exact amount.

## Impact
User's might not see their exact/desired amount get out during redeem from vault due to bad deadline check

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
either have a deadline check as such as uniswap
or set the deadine check in Trade as

```solidity
-- deadline: block.timestamp,
++ deadline: block.timestamp +20
 ```

> Note : the necessary changes should also be made while staking to a vault or redeeming from other vaults
