# Not checking  if a sequencer is  down or not in  a function to fetch rate from oracle can lead to outdated  and unordered data feed

## Summary
Not checking the sequencer can lead to stale data feed

## Vulnerability Detail
By not checking the  sequencer in `_getPTRate` function of the `PendlePTOracle.sol` contract,it can lead to fetching of unordered and outdated data feeds, use the ` _checkSequencer` function like its used in other functions of oracle

## Impact
Not checking the sequencer can lead to stale data feed

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _getPTRate() internal view returns (int256) {
        uint256 ptRate = useSyOracleRate ?
            Deployments.PENDLE_ORACLE.getPtToSyRate(pendleMarket, twapDuration) :
            Deployments.PENDLE_ORACLE.getPtToAssetRate(pendleMarket, twapDuration); 
        return ptRate.toInt();
    }
```
