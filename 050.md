# Inability to perform PendlePTStakedUSDeVault._executeInstantRedemption() as there is no sufficient liquidity for direct sUSDe -> USDe swap

## Summary

There will be no option to exit the `PendlePTStakedUSDeVault` vaults that have `accountWithdraw.requestId == 0`, as the `_executeInstantRedemption()` function will not work as expected due to a lack of liquidity for the sUSDe -> USDe swap.

## Vulnerability Detail

During a vault exit in the PendlePrincipalToken contract for an account with `accountWithdraw.requestId == 0`, the `_executeInstantRedemption()` function will be called. 

In that function:
* Firstly, the Pendle PT tokens will be redeemed into sUSDe tokens.
* Later, as the TOKEN_OUT_SY (sUSDe) are not equal to BORROW_TOKEN (USDe), the function will try to perform the trade using the TRADING_MODULE.

But due to insufficient or a lack of liquidity pools for a direct swap (sUSDe to USDe), as the `TradeType.EXACT_IN_SINGLE` is used and sUSDe is not supported by the 0x protocol, such a swap will either fail or lead to heavy user losses due to high slippage.

## Impact

The vault will not work as intended, forcing the user to either take heavy losses on instant redemption or lock the funds for the sUSDe withdrawal duration, leading them to pay interest fees for that time and remain in the unwanted leveraged trade.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Similar to the `EthenaVault` contract (out-of-scope), the `PendlePTStakedUSDeVault` contract should override the `_executeInstantRedemption()` function and use the `EthenaLib._sellStakedUSDe()` function.
