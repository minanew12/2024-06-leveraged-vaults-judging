# Same Reward can be claimed more than once.

## Summary
The `rewardToClaim` is never set to zero once `claimRewards` is called allowing the account to reenter and receive the same amount of tokens again.
## Vulnerability Detail
When an account calls `claimReward` in `VaultRewarderLib.sol` the state of the balance is never updated once the sending is done.
Therefore an account can call `claimReward` till all of the rewards in the vault are drained

## Impact
All funds can be drained .

## Recommendation
```diff
if (0 < rewardToClaim) {*
            try
                //@audit the state should be updated to zero then send to the account .. otherwise they call this function again and receive the same rewardTokens later.
               // introduce a new variable temporary to call transfer with
               
+             uint256 claim = rewardToClaim;
              // force rewardToClaim to zero to avoid  reentering 
+             rewardToClaim = 0; 
-                  IEIP20NonStandard(rewardToken).transfer(account, rewardToClaim);   
              // use the temporary variable to send.
+                IEIP20NonStandard(rewardToken).transfer(account, claim);
            {
                bool success = TokenUtils.checkReturnCode();
                if (success) {
                    emit VaultRewardTransfer(
                        rewardToken,
                        account,
                        rewardToClaim
                    );
                } else {
-                    emit VaultRewardTransfer(rewardToken, account, 0);
                     // revert so as to maintain state without account losing tokens.
+                   revert();
                }
                // Emits zero tokens transferred if the transfer fails.
            } catch {
-                emit VaultRewardTransfer(rewardToken, account, 0);
+              revert();
             }
        }
