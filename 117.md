# Rebasing tokens can break functionality of `getStakingTokensForVaultShare` function in `BaseStakingVault.sol`

## Summary
Using rebase tokens in `getStakingTokensForVaultShare` can break functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getStakingTokensForVaultShare` function has comments mentioning - 
```solidity
        // NOTE: this calculation works as long as staking tokens do not rebase and we do not
        // do any reinvestment into the staking token.
```
This means that the functionality of `getStakingTokensForVaultShare` can break if any rebasing token is used. 
Firstly there are no checks which ensures that no rebasing tokens are used.
Secondly, `stETH` which is being approved in the `triggerExtraStep` function of `Kelp.sol` is a rebasing token. See [here](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)

The protocol as per the documentation mentions use of the following tokens:
EtherFi: weETH, eETH
Ethena: USDe, sUSDe
Pendle: PT tokens
Kelp: rsETH
Use of stETH from Lido is not mentioned.

## Impact
If a function is not meant to handle rebasing tokens and rebasing tokens are being passed in it, then it breaks the functionality of that function. Which can lead to unexpected behavior of the protocol. Check potential hazards of using stETH [here](https://medium.com/eulerfinance/steth-and-the-hazards-of-rebasing-tokens-855ddfaa9a1b)

## Recommendation
Implement checks for ensuring that tokens which can enter the `getStakingTokensForVaultShare` function are not rebasing.
