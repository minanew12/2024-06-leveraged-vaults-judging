# Incorrect value calculation in `_getValueOfSplitFinalizedWithdrawRequest` due to missing decimals conversion


## Summary
If a withdraw request is split and finalized, `_getValueOfSplitFinalizedWithdrawRequest` will be invoked to calculate the value of the split request.
However, the function does not account for the decimals of the `borrowToken`, which can result in an incorrect value calculation when `borrowToken` is not `redeemToken`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`s.totalWithdraw` represents the amount of `redeemToken`, so when the `borrowToken` is not equal to `redeemToken`, the decimals conversion is neccessary for calculating the correct value.

```solidity
    return (s.totalWithdraw * rate.toUint() * w.vaultShares) / 
                (s.totalVaultShares * Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION);
```

## Impact
The incorrect value calculation can lead to an incorrect calculation of collateralRatio in notional VaultAcccountHealth, result in a loss of funds for the user.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/common/WithdrawRequestBase.sol#L80

```solidity
    function _getValueOfSplitFinalizedWithdrawRequest(
        WithdrawRequest memory w,
        SplitWithdrawRequest memory s,
        address borrowToken,
        address redeemToken
    ) internal virtual view returns (uint256) {
        // If the borrow token and the withdraw token match, then there is no need to apply
        // an exchange rate at this point.
        if (borrowToken == redeemToken) {
            return (s.totalWithdraw * w.vaultShares) / s.totalVaultShares;
        } else {
            // Otherwise, apply the proper exchange rate
            (int256 rate, /* */) = Deployments.TRADING_MODULE.getOraclePrice(redeemToken, borrowToken);

            return (s.totalWithdraw * rate.toUint() * w.vaultShares) / 
                (s.totalVaultShares * Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION); // @audit -high missing redeemDecimals to borrowDecimals conversion
        }
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended to add the borrowToken decimals conversion to the `_getValueOfSplitFinalizedWithdrawRequest` function to calculate the correct value when borrowToken is not equal to redeemToken.
