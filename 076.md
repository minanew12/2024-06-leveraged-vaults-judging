# For liquidators, a Denial of Service (DoS) could occur if vaultShares is not equal to vaultSharesRedeemed.


## Summary
For liquidators, a Denial of Service (DoS) could occur if vaultShares is not equal to vaultSharesRedeemed.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
function _redeemFromNotional(
        address account,
        uint256 vaultShares,
        uint256 maturity,
        bytes calldata data
    ) internal override returns (uint256 borrowedCurrencyAmount) {
        // Short circuit here to allow for direct repayment of debts. This method always
        // gets called by Notional on every exit, but in times of illiquidity an account
        // may want to pay down their debt without being able to instantly redeem their
        // vault shares to avoid liquidation.
        if (vaultShares == 0) return 0;

        WithdrawRequest memory accountWithdraw = getWithdrawRequest(account);

        RedeemParams memory params = abi.decode(data, (RedeemParams));
        if (accountWithdraw.requestId == 0) {
            return _executeInstantRedemption(account, vaultShares, maturity, params);
        } else {
            (
                uint256 vaultSharesRedeemed,
                uint256 tokensClaimed
            ) = _redeemActiveWithdrawRequest(account, accountWithdraw);
            // Once a withdraw request is initiated, the full amount must be redeemed from the vault.
@>>            require(vaultShares == vaultSharesRedeemed);

            // Trades may be required here if the borrowed token is not the same as what is
            // received when redeeming.
            if (BORROW_TOKEN != REDEMPTION_TOKEN) {
                Trade memory trade = Trade({
                    tradeType: TradeType.EXACT_IN_SINGLE,
                    sellToken: address(REDEMPTION_TOKEN),
                    buyToken: address(BORROW_TOKEN),
                    amount: tokensClaimed,
                    limit: params.minPurchaseAmount,
                    deadline: block.timestamp,
                    exchangeData: params.exchangeData
                });

                (/* */, tokensClaimed) = _executeTrade(params.dexId, trade);
            }

            return tokensClaimed;
        }
    }
```
When exiting the fund, due to the requirement in the _redeemFromNotional function that vaultShares == vaultSharesRedeemed, there can be cases of inequality for liquidators. For example:

	•	vaultShares is 9e8
	•	vaultSharesRedeemed is 1e8

## Impact
DoS could occur
