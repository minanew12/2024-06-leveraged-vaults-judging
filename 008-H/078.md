# The withdrawValue calculation in _calculateValueOfWithdrawRequest is incorrect.

The withdrawValue calculation in _calculateValueOfWithdrawRequest is incorrect.
## Summary
The withdrawValue calculation in _calculateValueOfWithdrawRequest is incorrect.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
function _calculateValueOfWithdrawRequest(
        WithdrawRequest memory w,
        uint256 stakeAssetPrice,
        address borrowToken,
        address redeemToken
    ) internal view returns (uint256 borrowTokenValue) {
        if (w.requestId == 0) return 0;

        // If a withdraw request has split and is finalized, we know the fully realized value of
        // the withdraw request as a share of the total realized value.
        if (w.hasSplit) {
            SplitWithdrawRequest memory s = VaultStorage.getSplitWithdrawRequest()[w.requestId];
            if (s.finalized) {
                return _getValueOfSplitFinalizedWithdrawRequest(w, s, borrowToken, redeemToken);
            }
        }

        // In every other case, including the case when the withdraw request has split, the vault shares
        // in the withdraw request (`w`) are marked at the amount of vault shares the account holds.
@>>        return _getValueOfWithdrawRequest(w, stakeAssetPrice);
    }
```
We can see that for cases without hasSplit or with hasSplit but not finalized, the value is calculated using _getValueOfWithdrawRequest. Letâ€™s take a look at `PendlePTEtherFiVault::_getValueOfWithdrawRequest()`.

```javascript
function _getValueOfWithdrawRequest(
        WithdrawRequest memory w, uint256 /* */
    ) internal override view returns (uint256) {
@>>        uint256 tokenOutSY = getTokenOutSYForWithdrawRequest(w.requestId);
        // NOTE: in this vault the tokenOutSy is known to be weETH.
        (int256 weETHPrice, /* */) = TRADING_MODULE.getOraclePrice(TOKEN_OUT_SY, BORROW_TOKEN);
        return (tokenOutSY * weETHPrice.toUint() * BORROW_PRECISION) /
            (WETH_PRECISION * Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION);
    }
```
Here, tokenOutSY represents the total amount of WETH requested for withdrawal, not just the portion represented by the possibly split w.vaultShares. Therefore, _getValueOfWithdrawRequest returns the entire withdrawal value. If a WithdrawRequest has been split but not finalized, this results in an incorrect calculation.

This issue also occurs in `PendlePTKelpVault::_getValueOfWithdrawRequest()`.
```javascript
function _getValueOfWithdrawRequest(
        WithdrawRequest memory w, uint256 /* */
    ) internal override view returns (uint256) {
        return KelpLib._getValueOfWithdrawRequest(w, BORROW_TOKEN, BORROW_PRECISION);
    }
//KelpLib._getValueOfWithdrawRequest) function
function _getValueOfWithdrawRequest(
        WithdrawRequest memory w,
        address borrowToken,
        uint256 borrowPrecision
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        address holder = address(uint160(w.requestId));

        uint256 expectedStETHAmount;
        if (KelpCooldownHolder(payable(holder)).triggered()) {
            uint256[] memory requestIds = LidoWithdraw.getWithdrawalRequests(holder);
            ILidoWithdraw.WithdrawalRequestStatus[] memory withdrawsStatus = LidoWithdraw.getWithdrawalStatus(requestIds);

            expectedStETHAmount = withdrawsStatus[0].amountOfStETH;
        } else {
            (/* */, expectedStETHAmount, /* */, /* */) = WithdrawManager.getUserWithdrawalRequest(stETH, holder, 0);

        }

        (int256 stETHToBorrowRate, /* */) = Deployments.TRADING_MODULE.getOraclePrice(
            address(stETH), borrowToken
        );
            //@audit not the w.vaulteShares
@>>        return (expectedStETHAmount * stETHToBorrowRate.toUint() * borrowPrecision) /
            (Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION * stETH_PRECISION);
    }
```

This issue also occurs in `PendlePTStakedUSDeVault::_getValueOfWithdrawRequest()`.
```javascript
function _getValueOfWithdrawRequest(
        WithdrawRequest memory w, uint256 /* */
    ) internal override view returns (uint256) {
        // NOTE: This withdraw valuation is not based on the vault shares value so we do not
        // need to use the PendlePT metadata conversion.
        return EthenaLib._getValueOfWithdrawRequest(w, BORROW_TOKEN, BORROW_PRECISION);
    }
//EthenaLib._getValueOfWithdrawRequest()
function _getValueOfWithdrawRequest(
        WithdrawRequest memory w,
        address borrowToken,
        uint256 borrowPrecision
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        address holder = address(uint160(w.requestId));
        // This valuation is the amount of USDe the account will receive at cooldown, once
        // a cooldown is initiated the account is no longer receiving sUSDe yield. This balance
        // of USDe is transferred to a Silo contract and guaranteed to be available once the
        // cooldown has passed.
        IsUSDe.UserCooldown memory userCooldown = sUSDe.cooldowns(holder);

        int256 usdeToBorrowRate;
        if (borrowToken == address(USDe)) {
            usdeToBorrowRate = int256(Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION);
        } else {
            // If not borrowing USDe, convert to the borrowed token
            (usdeToBorrowRate, /* */) = Deployments.TRADING_MODULE.getOraclePrice(
                address(USDe), borrowToken
            );
        }
        //@audit not the w.vaulteShares
@>>        return (userCooldown.underlyingAmount * usdeToBorrowRate.toUint() * borrowPrecision) /
            (Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION * USDE_PRECISION);
    }
```
The calculation is correct only in `EtherFiVault::_getValueOfWithdrawRequest()` .
```javascript
function _getValueOfWithdrawRequest(
        WithdrawRequest memory w, uint256 weETHPrice
    ) internal override view returns (uint256) {
        return EtherFiLib._getValueOfWithdrawRequest(w, weETHPrice, BORROW_PRECISION);
    }
//EtherFiLib._getValueOfWithdrawRequest() function
function _getValueOfWithdrawRequest(
        WithdrawRequest memory w,
        uint256 weETHPrice,
        uint256 borrowPrecision
    ) internal pure returns (uint256) {
            //@audit this is correct, using vaultShares
@>>        return (w.vaultShares * weETHPrice * borrowPrecision) /
            (uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION) * Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION);
    }
```

## Impact
Overestimation of user assets can lead to scenarios where users should have been liquidated but were not, resulting in losses for the protocol.
