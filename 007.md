# Missing oracle staleness check

## Summary
In _calculateBaseToQuote the updatedAt variable is still recorder but it is not used. The oracle may return stale data even if the sequencer is still up.
## Vulnerability Detail
The PendlePTOracle does check if the sequencer is up which ensures that the sequencer is operational and that the data can be trusted to a certain extent. If the sequencer is down, transactions might be delayed or not processed, leading to potential inaccuracies in the dataâ€‹. 
However this check still does not guarantee that the price data is accurate.
Even if the sequencer is operational, data from oracles can still become stale due to various reasons such as network delays or issues with the data providers. 
Therefore only checking if the sequencer is up is not enough.
## Impact
Stale price could cause arbitrage opportunities for users

## Recommendation
A staleness check ensures that the data you are using is recent and has been updated within an acceptable time frame.
