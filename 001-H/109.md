# Usage of hardcoded 0 as limit in _sellStakedUSDe() function allows for sandwich opportunities.

## Summary
The `Ethena.sol` contract has a function called `_sellStakedUSDe()` which does the following two things

1. Trade sUSDe into sDAI
2. Trade DAI into borrowToken after redeeming shares if borrowToken != DAI

The issue is that the `limit` field is hardcoded to `0` in the 1st Swap, this allows for  sandwiching opportunities every time this function is called.  

## Vulnerability Detail

The function is defined as

```solidity
function _sellStakedUSDe(
        uint256 sUSDeAmount,
        address borrowToken,
        uint256 minPurchaseAmount,
        bytes memory exchangeData,
        uint16 dexId
    ) internal returns (uint256 borrowedCurrencyAmount)
```

where `minPurchaseAmount` is the slippage parameter. This parameter is not used for the first swap and is used later for the 2nd swap.

The vulnerability lies in the the following code where no value for limit is being passed

```solidity
Trade memory sDAITrade = Trade({
            tradeType: TradeType.EXACT_IN_SINGLE,
            sellToken: address(sUSDe),
            buyToken: address(sDAI),
            amount: sUSDeAmount,
            limit: 0, // NOTE: no slippage guard is set here, it is enforced in the second leg of the trade.
            deadline: block.timestamp,
            exchangeData: abi.encode(CurveV2Adapter.CurveV2SingleData({
                pool: 0x167478921b907422F8E88B43C4Af2B8BEa278d3A,
                fromIndex: 1, // sUSDe
                toIndex: 0 // sDAI
            }))
        });
```

and the following are the params for the second swap, Note that this trade will only execute only if the borrowToken is not DAI. So only when the 2nd swap happens, then the limit is being enforced.

```solidity
if (borrowToken != address(DAI)) {
            Trade memory trade = Trade({
                tradeType: TradeType.EXACT_IN_SINGLE,
                sellToken: address(DAI),
                buyToken: borrowToken,
                amount: daiAmount,
                limit: minPurchaseAmount,
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                exchangeData: exchangeData
            });
```

There are a few cases that can occur here.

1. Attacker sees the minPurchaseAmount being used when the borrowToken is not DAI, front runs the first swap and changes reserves to the point where minPurchaseAmount will still pass the second swap, the first swap is executed followed by the second swap and the attacker backruns to gain their profit.

2. Attacker sees the function being executed when the borrowToken is DAI, front runs the first swap and changes reserves heavily since no revert can occur due to `minPurchaseAmount` not being fulfilled (2nd swap will not happen due to no entry into the if block) and after the first swap, the attacker backruns to gain their profit.


## Impact

Loss of funds which should not be possible if a limit is also used for the first swap
