# `_claimRewardToken` function in `VaultRewarderLib` contract uses `IEIP20NonStandard` which makes protocol vulnerable to weird ERC20 behaviors.

## Summary
The `_claimRewardToken` function in `VaultRewarderLib` contract uses `IEIP20NonStandard` , which is an unsafe version of ERC20 implementation that can lead to vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_claimRewardToken` function in `VaultRewarderLib` contract uses `IEIP20NonStandard` , which is an unsafe version of ERC20 implementation without safety checks.
The library clearly mentions on the top that "Version of ERC20 with no return values for `transfer` and `transferFrom`" and also links an article with 130 different tokens affected due to this vulnerability [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/missing-return-value-bug-at-least-130-tokens-affected-d67bf08521ca) but still it is being used by the protocol. 

The comment above the function - 
```solidity
            // Ignore transfer errors here so that any strange failures here do not
            // prevent normal vault operations from working. Failures may include a
            // lack of balances or some sort of blacklist that prevents an account
            // from receiving tokens.
```
Link to code - [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/14d3eaf0445c251c52c86ce88a84a3f5b9dfad94/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/common/VaultRewarderLib.sol#L295-L328)

The comment shows that the protocol is making and assumption that we should ignore `transfer errors` and any `strange failure` and it doesn't prevent normal functioning of the vault. If we consider that assumption as correct, then there should be checks present to ensure using `IEIP20NonStandard` is safe. 

In the `IEIP20NonStandard` contract it is clearly mentioned above the `transfer` function - 
```solidity
  /// !!! NOTICE !!! `transfer` does not return a value, in violation of the ERC-20 specification
```
While this can be considered as a design choice , only viable reason to use an non-standard version of ERC20 implementation than the standard one, can be the non-standard version provides certain features that the standard and safe version doesn't.

## Impact
Using non-standard version of ERC20 implementation can lead to protocol encountering unexpected failure and give bad user experience.

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions
Handle non-standard-compliant tokens
