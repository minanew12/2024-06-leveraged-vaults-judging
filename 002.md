#  `PendlePrincipalToken::_redeemPT()` does not handle ERC20 tokens with special `transfer` implementation

## Summary

Calls to `ERC20::transfer` method should always be checked

## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens do not revert on failure in `transfer` but instead return `false` as a return value (for example `ZRX`). Moreover, some tokens might have custom implementations that do not adhere strictly to the ERC-20 standard, resulting in potential failures. Because of this it has become a common practice to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 to handle such weird tokens. 

Even though PT tokens are known to be ERC20 compatible if transfer fails, but does not revert it can leave tokens stuck in the contract.

## Impact

The impact is potentially permanently lost (stuck) value for users of the protocol, but it needs a special ERC20 token to be used as underlying or to be sent in contract by mistake.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/PendlePrincipalToken.sol#L124-L138

```javascript
function _redeemPT(uint256 vaultShares) internal returns (uint256 netTokenOut) {
    uint256 netPtIn = getStakingTokensForVaultShare(vaultShares);
    uint256 netSyOut;

    // PT tokens are known to be ERC20 compatible
    if (PT.isExpired()) {
@>      PT.transfer(address(YT), netPtIn);
        netSyOut = YT.redeemPY(address(SY));
    } else {
@>      PT.transfer(address(MARKET), netPtIn);
        (netSyOut, ) = MARKET.swapExactPtForSy(address(SY), netPtIn, "");
    }

    netTokenOut = SY.redeem(address(this), netSyOut, TOKEN_OUT_SY, 0, true);
}
```
