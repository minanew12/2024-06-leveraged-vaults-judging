# Off-by-one in `EthenaCooldownHolder._canFinalizeWithdrawRequest()` function

## Summary

Withdrawal request finalization should also be possible at the `cooldownEnd` timestamp.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `return (userCooldown.cooldownEnd < block.timestamp || 0 == duration);` check, the operator `<` should be replaced with `<=`.

## Impact

This is an informational-level issue as there are no gains associated with this mistake.
