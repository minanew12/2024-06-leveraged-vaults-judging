# Value of vault shares can be manipulated

## Summary

The value of vault shares can be manipulated. Inflating the value of vault shares is often the precursor of more complex attacks. Internal (Notional-side) or external protocols that integrate with the vault shares might be susceptible to potential attacks in the future that exploit this issue.

## Vulnerability Detail

It was found that the value of the vault shares can be manipulated.

##### Instance 1 - Kelp

To increase the value of vault share, malicious can directly transfer a large number of stETH to their `KelpCooldownHolder` contract. In Line 78, the holder contract will determine the number of stETH to be withdrawn from LIDO via `IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this))`. This means that all the stETH tokens residing on the holder contract, including the ones that are maliciously transferred in, will be withdrawn from LIDO.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/Kelp.sol#L78

```solidity
File: Kelp.sol
69:     /// @notice this method need to be called once withdraw on Kelp is finalized
70:     /// to start withdraw process from Lido so we can unwrap stETH to ETH
71:     /// since we are not able to withdraw ETH directly from Kelp
72:     function triggerExtraStep() external {
73:         require(!triggered);
74:         (/* */, /* */, /* */, uint256 userWithdrawalRequestNonce) = WithdrawManager.getUserWithdrawalRequest(stETH, address(this), 0);
75:         require(userWithdrawalRequestNonce < WithdrawManager.nextLockedNonce(stETH));
76: 
77:         WithdrawManager.completeWithdrawal(stETH);
78:         uint256 tokensClaimed = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
79: 
80:         uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
81:         amounts[0] = tokensClaimed;
82:         IERC20(stETH).approve(address(LidoWithdraw), amounts[0]);
83:         LidoWithdraw.requestWithdrawals(amounts, address(this));
84: 
85:         triggered = true;
86:     }
```

When determining the value of vault share of a user, the `convertStrategyToUnderlying` function will be called, which internally calls `_getValueOfWithdrawRequest` function.

The `withdrawsStatus[0].amountOfStETH` at Line 126 will be inflated as the amount will include the stETH attackers maliciously transferred earlier. As a result, the vault share will be inflated.

```solidity
File: Kelp.sol
114:     function _getValueOfWithdrawRequest(
115:         WithdrawRequest memory w,
116:         address borrowToken,
117:         uint256 borrowPrecision
118:     ) internal view returns (uint256) {
119:         address holder = address(uint160(w.requestId));
120: 
121:         uint256 expectedStETHAmount;
122:         if (KelpCooldownHolder(payable(holder)).triggered()) {
123:             uint256[] memory requestIds = LidoWithdraw.getWithdrawalRequests(holder);
124:             ILidoWithdraw.WithdrawalRequestStatus[] memory withdrawsStatus = LidoWithdraw.getWithdrawalStatus(requestIds);
125: 
126:             expectedStETHAmount = withdrawsStatus[0].amountOfStETH;
127:         } else {
128:             (/* */, expectedStETHAmount, /* */, /* */) = WithdrawManager.getUserWithdrawalRequest(stETH, holder, 0);
129: 
130:         }
131: 
132:         (int256 stETHToBorrowRate, /* */) = Deployments.TRADING_MODULE.getOraclePrice(
133:             address(stETH), borrowToken
134:         );
135: 
136:         return (expectedStETHAmount * stETHToBorrowRate.toUint() * borrowPrecision) /
137:             (Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION * stETH_PRECISION);
138:     }
```

#### Instance 2 - Ethena

Etherna vault is vulnerable to similar issue due to the due of `.balanceOf` at Line 37 below.

Before starting the cooldown, malicious user can directly transfer in a large number of sUSDe to the `EthenaCooldownHolder` holder contract.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/main/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/Ethena.sol#L37

```solidity
File: Ethena.sol
35:     function _startCooldown() internal override {
36:         uint24 duration = sUSDe.cooldownDuration();
37:         uint256 balance = sUSDe.balanceOf(address(this));
38:         if (duration == 0) {
39:             // If the cooldown duration is set to zero, can redeem immediately
40:             sUSDe.redeem(balance, address(this), address(this));
41:         } else {
42:             // If we execute a second cooldown while one exists, the cooldown end
43:             // will be pushed further out. This holder should only ever have one
44:             // cooldown ever.
45:             require(sUSDe.cooldowns(address(this)).cooldownEnd == 0);
46:             sUSDe.cooldownShares(balance);
47:         }
48:     }
```

Thus, when code in Lines 87 and 99 are executed, the `userCooldown.underlyingAmount` returns will be large, which inflates the value of the vault shares.

077:     function _getValueOfWithdrawRequest(
078:         WithdrawRequest memory w,
079:         address borrowToken,
080:         uint256 borrowPrecision
081:     ) internal view returns (uint256) {
082:         address holder = address(uint160(w.requestId));
083:         // This valuation is the amount of USDe the account will receive at cooldown, once
084:         // a cooldown is initiated the account is no longer receiving sUSDe yield. This balance
085:         // of USDe is transferred to a Silo contract and guaranteed to be available once the
086:         // cooldown has passed.
087:         IsUSDe.UserCooldown memory userCooldown = sUSDe.cooldowns(holder);
088: 
089:         int256 usdeToBorrowRate;
090:         if (borrowToken == address(USDe)) {
091:             usdeToBorrowRate = int256(Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION);
092:         } else {
093:             // If not borrowing USDe, convert to the borrowed token
094:             (usdeToBorrowRate, /* */) = Deployments.TRADING_MODULE.getOraclePrice(
095:                 address(USDe), borrowToken
096:             );
097:         }
098: 
099:         return (userCooldown.underlyingAmount * usdeToBorrowRate.toUint() * borrowPrecision) /
100:             (Constants.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION * USDE_PRECISION);
101:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

**Instance 1 - Kelp**

Consider using the before and after balances to determine the actual number of stETH obtained after the execution of `WithdrawManager.completeWithdrawal` function to guard against potential donation attacks.

```diff
function triggerExtraStep() external {
    require(!triggered);
    (/* */, /* */, /* */, uint256 userWithdrawalRequestNonce) = WithdrawManager.getUserWithdrawalRequest(stETH, address(this), 0);
    require(userWithdrawalRequestNonce < WithdrawManager.nextLockedNonce(stETH));
+		uint256 tokenBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
    WithdrawManager.completeWithdrawal(stETH);
+		uint256 tokenAfter = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));

-    uint256 tokensClaimed = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
+    uint256 tokensClaimed = tokenAfter - tokenBefore

    uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
    amounts[0] = tokensClaimed;
    IERC20(stETH).approve(address(LidoWithdraw), amounts[0]);
    LidoWithdraw.requestWithdrawals(amounts, address(this));

    triggered = true;
}
```

**Instance 2 - Ethena**

Pass in the actual amount of sUSDe that needs to be withdrawn instead of using the `balanceOf`.

```diff
- function _startCooldown() internal override {
+ function _startCooldown(uint256 balance) internal override {
    uint24 duration = sUSDe.cooldownDuration();
-    uint256 balance = sUSDe.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (duration == 0) {
        // If the cooldown duration is set to zero, can redeem immediately
        sUSDe.redeem(balance, address(this), address(this));
    } else {
        // If we execute a second cooldown while one exists, the cooldown end
        // will be pushed further out. This holder should only ever have one
        // cooldown ever.
        require(sUSDe.cooldowns(address(this)).cooldownEnd == 0);
        sUSDe.cooldownShares(balance);
    }
}
```
