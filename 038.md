# `VaultRewarderLib._claimVaultRewards()` call can be front-run to steal incentive gains from boosting protocols

## Summary

When sufficient incentives accumulate for VaultRewarderLib to cover Notional fees and provide gains to the attacker, those gains can be stolen.

## Vulnerability Detail

Every time `VaultRewarderLib._claimVaultRewards()` is called, there is a surge in rewards per share in the vault. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker can accumulate a significant portion of shares before the claim and then exit shortly after.

While there are limitations to mitigate this behavior in the Notional core protocol, if a trigger bot malfunctions and vault state reaches the `forceClaimAfter` deadline, the attacker can directly trigger `_claimVaultRewards()`. In such a scenario, the accumulated incentives due to prolonged outage could be sufficient, especially for multi token incentive vaults.

This attack effectively allows the attacker to steal a major portion of the newly added rewards.

## Impact

Stealing incentive tokens from other users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider switching the `Account Claim` reward model from directly increasing `accumulatedRewardPerVaultShare` to a reward rate-based gradual release model.
