# Missing circuit breaker checks for chainlink price feeds

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink price feeds provide an aggregated answer from several sources (nodes) in the `latestAnswer` value. The answer is updated when the price changes a certain percentage in each direction or once every X hours depending on the feed. 
Chainlink aggregators have a built-in **circuit** **breaker** if the price of an asset goes outside a predetermined price ranges, which could lead to incorrect returned price.

In instances of significant price fluctuations such as a crash in the value of an asset, the oracle's reported price will persistently reflect either the **minimum** or **maximum** price within the predetermined band: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits

This happened to Venus on BSC when Terra LUNA crashed: https://therecord.media/collapse-of-luna-cryptocurrency-leads-to-11-million-exploit-on-venus-protocol

An example of such price feed log can be seen here
https://etherscan.io/address/0xf1F7F7BFCc5E9D6BB8D9617756beC06A5Cbe1a49#readContract#F19

According to the protocol docs and answer from the sponsors the protocol would use any chainlink price feeds that get the asset price in USD - for example `ETH/USD`

## Impact
If the token crashes and the min answer is hit this could make swaps that are **non-profitable** for the protocol, due to wrong price returned. Hence loss of funds due to non-profitable trades.

## Tool used
Manual Review, Chainlink Docs

## Recommendation
Add checks that revert the transaction if the min/max values are hit.

```diff
// Add minAnswer and maxAnswer in the constructor here
...
function _calculateBaseToQuote() internal view returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    ) {
        _checkSequencer();

        int256 baseToUSD;
        (
            roundId,
            baseToUSD,
            startedAt,
            updatedAt,
            answeredInRound
        ) = baseToUSDOracle.latestRoundData();
-       require(baseToUSD > 0, "Chainlink Rate Error");
+.     require(baseToUSD > minAnswer, "Min Answer Hit");
+.     require(baseToUSD < maxAnswer, "Max Answer Hit");

        // Overflow and div by zero not possible
        if (invertBase) baseToUSD = (baseToUSDDecimals * baseToUSDDecimals) / baseToUSD;

        // Past expiration, hardcode the PT oracle price to 1. It is no longer tradable and
        // is worth 1 unit of the underlying SY at expiration.
        int256 ptRate = expiry <= block.timestamp ? ptDecimals : _getPTRate();

        answer = (ptRate * baseToUSD * rateDecimals) /
            (baseToUSDDecimals * ptDecimals);
    }
```
