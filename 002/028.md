# Users can get less amount of tokens while instant redeeming due to lack of slippage checks

## Summary
Users can get less amount of tokens while instant redeeming due to lack of slippage checks
## Vulnerability Detail
`_executeInstantRedemption` function in `PendlePrincipalToken.sol` is used to redeem tokens, however while doing so it calculates `netTokenOut` by calling the function `_redeemPT(vaultShares)`, the problem is while redeeming  `minTokenOut` is set to 0 which could lead to getting less amount of tokens while redeeming than intended.

```solidity
 function _redeemPT(uint256 vaultShares) internal returns (uint256 netTokenOut) {
        uint256 netPtIn = getStakingTokensForVaultShare(vaultShares); 
        uint256 netSyOut;
        // PT tokens are known to be ERC20 compatible
        if (PT.isExpired()) {
            PT.transfer(address(YT), netPtIn);
            netSyOut = YT.redeemPY(address(SY));
        } else {
            PT.transfer(address(MARKET), netPtIn);
            (netSyOut,) = MARKET.swapExactPtForSy(address(SY), netPtIn, ""); 
        }

        netTokenOut = SY.redeem(address(this), netSyOut, TOKEN_OUT_SY, 0, true);//@audit `minTokenOut` is set to 0
    }
```
    
`netTokenOut ` is calculated from calling `SY.redeem` and if we see the implementation of `redeem` , `minTokenOut` should actually revert if amount of base token redeemed is lower than this, but since `minTokenOut` is set to 0 it means any amount is acceptable while redeeming and so the users will actually be prone to slippage issues here and can lose substantial amount of tokens while redeeming :
    
```solidity
       /**
     * @notice redeems an amount of base tokens by burning some shares
     * @param receiver recipient address
     * @param amountSharesToRedeem amount of shares to be burned
     * @param tokenOut address of the base token to be redeemed
     * @param minTokenOut reverts if amount of base token redeemed is lower than this
     * @param burnFromInternalBalance if true, burns from balance of `address(this)`, otherwise burns from `msg.sender`
     * @return amountTokenOut amount of base tokens redeemed
     * @dev Emits a {Redeem} event
     *
     * Requirements:
     * - (`tokenOut`) must be a valid base token.
     */
    function redeem(
        address receiver,
        uint256 amountSharesToRedeem,
        address tokenOut,
        uint256 minTokenOut,
        bool burnFromInternalBalance
    ) external returns (uint256 amountTokenOut);
```
    
    
    
## Impact
Users getting less tokens than intended

## Recommendation

Recommended fix would be to pass `minTokenOut` as params to allow for a specific amount of slippage by the users itself.
