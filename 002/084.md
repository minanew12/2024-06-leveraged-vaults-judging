# `_redeemPT` uses 0 slippage

## Summary
Notional will burn the shares to mint at a lower share value due to volatility or forced MEV. To protect from these, the slippage used is 0. That is the root cause and redeeming less amounts out than deserving is the impact.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_redeemPT` below calls `SY.redeem` with 0 as `minTokenOut`. If you look at `SYBase.redeem`, there is a slippage check if `amountTokenOut < minTokenOut`. So, if you input 0 as min out then it is not slippage protected and prone to MEV attacks.

`_redeemPT` is called in 3 flows,
1. [BaseStrategyVault.redeemFromNotional](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/14d3eaf0445c251c52c86ce88a84a3f5b9dfad94/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/common/BaseStrategyVault.sol#L171) -> [BaseStakingVault._redeemFromNotional](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/14d3eaf0445c251c52c86ce88a84a3f5b9dfad94/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L136) -> [EthenaVault._executeInstantRedemption](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/14d3eaf0445c251c52c86ce88a84a3f5b9dfad94/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/EthenaVault.sol#L99) -> [PendlePrincipalToken._redeemPT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/14d3eaf0445c251c52c86ce88a84a3f5b9dfad94/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/PendlePrincipalToken.sol#L124)
2. [BaseStakingVault.initiateWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/14d3eaf0445c251c52c86ce88a84a3f5b9dfad94/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/BaseStakingVault.sol#L249) -> [EtherFi._initiateWithdrawImpl](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/14d3eaf0445c251c52c86ce88a84a3f5b9dfad94/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/EtherFi.sol#L24) -> [PendlePrincipalToken._redeemPT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/14d3eaf0445c251c52c86ce88a84a3f5b9dfad94/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/protocols/PendlePrincipalToken.sol#L124)

Flow 2 has internal overrides with custom implementation at [_initiateSYWithdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-leveraged-vaults/blob/14d3eaf0445c251c52c86ce88a84a3f5b9dfad94/leveraged-vaults-private/contracts/vaults/staking/PendlePTEtherFiVault.sol#L56) between `initiateWithdraw` -> `_initiateWithdrawImpl`

Flow 1 is `onlyNotional`, but flow 2 can be called by any notional `account`
It doesn't matter even if you use private mempool to redeem, the redemption is subjected to slippage loss. There is no guarantee that slippage will be zero or 100%, because its possible if the minimum amount input is 0, which is the case here. Due to high volatility, the share price may go too low, and we end up burning our shares at low prices leading to lower redemption amounts.
And in flow 2, if a private mempool is not used, the it is subjected to MEV. Someone will redeem by burning the shares, then backrun Notional account's redemption, by depositing to mint shares at a much lower price.

```solidity
    function _redeemPT(uint256 vaultShares) internal returns (uint256 netTokenOut) {
        uint256 netPtIn = getStakingTokensForVaultShare(vaultShares);
...SNIP...

>>>>    netTokenOut = SY.redeem(address(this), netSyOut, TOKEN_OUT_SY, 0, true);
    }
```

```solidity
    function redeem(
        address receiver,
        uint256 amountSharesToRedeem,
        address tokenOut,
  >>>>  uint256 minTokenOut,
        bool burnFromInternalBalance
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 amountTokenOut) {
...SNIP...

        amountTokenOut = _redeem(receiver, tokenOut, amountSharesToRedeem);
  >>>>  if (amountTokenOut < minTokenOut) revert Errors.SYInsufficientTokenOut(amountTokenOut, minTokenOut);
        emit Redeem(msg.sender, receiver, tokenOut, amountSharesToRedeem, amountTokenOut);
    }
```

## Impact
Notional will burn the shares to mint at a lower share value due to volatility or forced MEV. To protect from these, the slippage used is 0. That is the root cause and redeeming less amounts out than deserving is the impact.
High impact due to loss of funds and likelihood is always due to hardcoded 0 slippage amount.
