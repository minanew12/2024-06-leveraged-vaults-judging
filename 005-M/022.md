# PendlePTKelpVault allows anyone to finalize a withdraw for any account, which can lead to less rewards received for users

## Summary

The whole function flow for `BaseStakingVault::finalizeWithdrawsManual()` for the `PendlePTKelpVault` contract has no permission checks allowing anyone to claim rewards for any user, however this can lead to users losing out on rewards due to claims that are executed before latest Lido rewards are distributed.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user calls `claimWithdrawal` to claim their queued withdrawal from Lido, the latest checkpoint is utilised to determine the current `shareRate` for `stETH -> ETH`. This `shareRate` increases with ~daily rewards distributions.

When comparing recent `claimWithdrawal` calls to the [Lido WithdrawalQueueBase](https://etherscan.deth.net/address/0x889edC2eDab5f40e902b864aD4d7AdE8E412F9B1), depending on when a withdrawal is claimed, a user may receive more or less `ETH` due to the `shareRate` at the most recent checkpoint:

In the latest claim at `Jul-02-2024 02:56:23 PM UTC` the `shareRate = 1171227098896131798671279699`

Whilst at the time of a seperate claim 2 days before the one above at `Jun-30-2024 09:38:23 AM UTC` the `shareRate = 1170651529823668241456867568`

## Impact

Allowing anyone, under no specific circumstance, to call `finalizeWithdrawsManual` for LIDO `stETH` allows a griefer to finalize a user's withdrawal earlier than a user may want to call the function. Imagine a user knows their withdrawal has just finalized and can be claimed, however they wish to wait for the latest rewards to be distributed to allow them to redeem their claim with a higher `shareRate`, this happens daily therefore this does not cause any risks for the protocol and may only require waiting a few hours to receive more `ETH` from their withdrawal.

However any user can call `finalizeWithdrawsManual` before the latest rewards are distributed, causing the user to lose out on rewards that will be distributed very soon. This leads to users potentially losing out on to-be earned rewards, classifying this as a Medium risk vulnerability as it relies on an external factor of a user griefing using the provided functionality. 

There is also a game-theoretical aspect to this as all rewards are distributed between all `stETH` holders, meaning one holder benefits from less `stETH` in circulation. If there is a large withdrawal that has just become claimable, then a user can call the `claimWithdrawal` function to reduce the amount of `stETH` shares that will be present during the upcoming reward distribution, meaning that user can receive a larger share of the new rewards if a large withdrawal is claimed beforehand.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only allow the user to finalize their own withdrawal, add permissioned access for bots to perform this action on accounts that have not claimed their finalized withdrawal for a long time. Also consider setting a timeframe in which a user must finalize their own withdrawal, after which anyone can call this function (E.g. 3 days).

This would give the users control to await the most recent reward distribution before claiming, whilst keeping the intended functionality of allowing anyone to finalize any withdrawal that can potentially affect protocol health.
