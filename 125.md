# Incomplete Handling of Sequencer Uptime Checking

## Summary
The _checkSequencer function is responsible for verifying the uptime status of a sequencer oracle. However, it lacks the implementation of a fallback mechanism (sequencerUptimeFeed) to handle updates for Layer 2 (L2) updates, potentially leading to inaccurate or incomplete uptime checks.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function directly relies on sequencerUptimeOracle to obtain real-time data for determining the sequencer's uptime status.
It lacks an implementation or fallback mechanism (sequencerUptimeFeed) to handle scenarios where sequencerUptimeOracle may be unavailable, outdated, or unreliable.

## Impact
- Without implementing sequencerUptimeFeed, the function solely depends on the real-time data from sequencerUptimeOracle. If the oracle data becomes outdated or unavailable due to network issues or oracle failures, the function may incorrectly assert the sequencer as down (Sequencer Down).
- Lack of a fallback mechanism also hinders the ability to handle specific Layer 2 (L2) updates that could affect the uptime status of the sequencer.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implementing sequencerUptimeFeed and enhancing the fallback strategy within _checkSequencer will mitigate the risk associated with relying solely on sequencerUptimeOracle. This proactive approach ensures the application remains resilient against oracle failures, maintains accurate uptime monitoring, and enhances overall system reliability, especially in environments where uptime data may fluctuate or become temporarily unavailable.
