# In the _claimAccountRewards function, skipping the third-party reward claim might cause losses for users.


## Summary
In the _claimAccountRewards function, skipping the third-party reward claim might cause losses for users.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
   function _claimAccountRewards(
        address account,
        uint256 totalVaultSharesBefore,
        uint256 vaultSharesBefore,
        uint256 vaultSharesAfter
    ) internal {
        (VaultRewardState[] memory state, StrategyVaultSettings memory s, RewardPoolStorage memory r) = getRewardSettings();
@>>        if (r.lastClaimTimestamp + s.forceClaimAfter < block.timestamp) {
@>>             _claimVaultRewards(totalVaultSharesBefore, state, r);
        }

        for (uint256 i; i < state.length; i++) {
            if (0 < state[i].emissionRatePerYear) {
                // Accumulate any rewards with an emission rate hereï¼Œ
                _accumulateSecondaryRewardViaEmissionRate(i, state[i], totalVaultSharesBefore);
            }

            _claimRewardToken(
                state[i].rewardToken,
                account,
                vaultSharesBefore,
                vaultSharesAfter,
                state[i].accumulatedRewardPerVaultShare
            );
        }
    }
```
Skipping the third-party reward claim during a certain time period, although it can save some gas, may cause a loss of rewards for users. This is especially true if the third-party rewards increase non-linearly, as there might be a significant amount of rewards available during that specific period.

## Impact
This can result in users losing a portion of their rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
-     if (r.lastClaimTimestamp + s.forceClaimAfter < block.timestamp) {
             _claimVaultRewards(totalVaultSharesBefore, state, r);
-        }
```
