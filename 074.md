# Potential overflow when calculating rewards

## Summary

The contract `VaultRewarderLib` utilizes `.toUint128()` in functions `_accumulateSecondaryRewardViaClaim` and `_accumulateSecondaryRewardViaEmissionRate` to convert calculated values into uint128. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`.toUint128()` is used to convert larger integer values into uint128. In scenarios where the converted value exceeds the maximum range of uint128, the conversion will truncate the value. This can lead to loss of precision or unintended behavior if the original value is larger than what uint128 can accommodate therefore the rewards will be calculated wrong.


## Impact

If the calculated values exceed 2^128 - 1 (the maximum value for uint128), `.toUint128()` will truncate the value without throwing an error. This could result in inaccurate representation of accumulated rewards per vault share or timestamp, potentially impacting subsequent operations relying on these values.


## Example of Overflow

Consider a scenario where `_accumulateSecondaryRewardViaClaim` calculates the `accumulatedRewardPerVaultShare` that exceeds 2^128 - 1. Let's assume:

```javascript
tokensClaimed = 2^120 (a large number for illustration)
Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION = 10^8
totalVaultSharesBefore = 10^18 (for simplicity)
```

The calculation would be:

```javascript
state.accumulatedRewardPerVaultShare += (
    (tokensClaimed * uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION)) / totalVaultSharesBefore
).toUint128();
```
Substitute the values:
```javascript
state.accumulatedRewardPerVaultShare += (
    (2^120 * 10^8) / 10^18
).toUint128();
```
Simplifying the expression:
```javascript
state.accumulatedRewardPerVaultShare += (2^120 * 10^8) / 10^18
state.accumulatedRewardPerVaultShare += 2^108 * 10^8
```
If 2^108 * 10^8 exceeds 2^128 - 1, the result will be truncated to fit within uint128, potentially leading to an incorrect value for `accumulatedRewardPerVaultShare`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Validate Input Range: Ensure that inputs to calculations leading to `.toUint128()` do not exceed the maximum value that uint128 can handle (2^128 - 1).

Use SafeMath: Implement SafeMath or similar libraries to prevent arithmetic overflow and underflow, ensuring that calculations remain within safe limits.
